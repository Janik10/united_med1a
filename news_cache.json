Follow live", "content": "Mandy reminds the jury Patterson had a right to silence and did not have to testify in the trial. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to provide anything and yet she decided to give evidence and subject herself to several days of cross-examination by a very experienced barrister.\u201d He says in doing so Patterson opened herself up to juror\u2019s scrutiny and the \u201cscrutiny of the whole world.\u201d Mandy tells the jury the prosecution\u2019s theory of Patterson making individual beef wellingtons fails if they cannot prove a non-poisoned pasty exists. He says the prosecution\u2019s case means Patterson would have eaten all of her beef wellington otherwise there would have been non-poisoned beef wellingtons in her bin. Patterson previously told the court that she did not eat all of her beef wellington and the remnants were in the bin outside her home. \u201cIf her portions were in the bin then her portions were poisoned,\u201d Mandy says. Mandy says Patterson only disposed of the dehydrator after the meal. He says if she planned to murder her lunch guests she would have disposed of the dehydrator well before the lunch. He says it is unlikely Patterson would have posted photos of the dehydrator, which the prosecution alleges is the murder weapon, in a group chat with Facebook friends she met in an online true crime group. He says Patterson driving to the tip to dispose of the dehydrator in her own car and paying for this with her own bank card highlight what \u201ccan only be panic\u201d. Mandy says if Patterson was a murderer she would have known the \u201cspotlight\u201d would be on her when her guests were hospitalised. He says it was \u201cinevitable the focus will be on the cook\u201d. Mandy says it was not a secret that Patterson had invited the lunch guests to her house. \u201cIt\u2019s all out in the open,\u201d he says. \u201cShe decided to cook a lavish and complicated dish \u2026 Not just a simple bolognese. But something much more impressive.\u201d He says if Patterson was planning to murder her lunch guests she would not have bought a dehydrator from a local store under her own name, take photos of the dehydrator and mushrooms in the appliance and post these images in a Facebook group chat. \u201cErin Patterson did the opposite of all those things because she didn\u2019t plan it,\u201d he says. He says Patterson panicked after the meal because she knew the spotlight would be on her. \u201cNot only is there no motive, there are very good reasons not to harm these people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you do embark on this plan \u2026 you\u2019ll lose the only people in the world who are any support to you and your children, you will lose your children and you will lose everything that\u2019s important to you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that anyone in those circumstances would make that choice.\u201d Justice Christopher Beale tells the jury he will begin instructing them ahead of their deliberations on Monday. He says this may \u201cspill over into Wednesday\u201d. \u201cWith a wind in my back I may finish by Tuesday afternoon,\u201d he says. Mandy says Simon told the jury Patterson sent an \u201caggressive\u201d message about child support to a group chat with his parents on the app Signal in December 2022. He says the next day the defence, during cross-examination, showed Simon these messages. Simon then said these were not the messages he was referring to, the court hears. \u201cThen his memory became it was at some other time. Still in this group chat.\u201d Mandy says the disagreement between Patterson and Simon did not provide \u201cany kind of motive to murder someone\u2019s parents and their aunt and uncle\u201d, he says. Mandy says the tone of the messages in the group chat from early December to when Patterson travelled to New Zealand with her children later that month are \u201con an even keel\u201d. \u201cThey might be functional, they might be mechanical, but these two people were not warring,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is not anger or aggression.\u201d He points to a message Patterson sent Simon on 18 December 2022 asking for help because a tree had fallen across a fence at her property and one of her goats was in a neighbour\u2019s yard. Simon replied that he was interstate but was happy to help when he returned, the court hears. Defence claims prosecution has been \u2018scratching around\u2019 Mandy says without a motive the jury is \u201cleft guessing about the most important element of this trial and that\u2019s intention\u201d, he says. He says the prosecution has spent a lot of time \u201cscratching around\u201d to find evidence about animosity in Patterson\u2019s family dynamics. He points to evidence the prosecution led about Patterson and Simon having a dispute about child support and other financial arrangements in December 2022. \u201cThey want to show there was some kind of difficulty \u2026 and that might provide a reason to murder his parents and his aunt and uncle six months later,\u201d he says. \u201cEven saying it aloud \u2026 shows how unpersuasive that argument is.\u201d Mandy says the disputes over finances for their children occurred over a few days in December 2022. \u201cIt was a brief spat, we say, about child support, which the evidence says was resolved amicably.\u201d \u201cObviously Erin was upset. She freely acknowledged that. She was venting to her Facebook friends \u2026 even months before the lunch.\u201d Mandy says another reason to consider that the lunch guests were good and kind people is because Patterson had no reason to harm them. He says he will touch on the absence of a motive, as the prosecution predicted in their closing address. Mandy reminds the jury that the prosecution does not have to prove motive. But he says one element of the offence of murder is intention to kill or cause serious injury. \u201cThey have to prove that\u2019s what Erin Patterson meant to do,\u201d he says. \u201cProof of a motive or the fact of a motive can be very important to intention.\u201d Jurors must put \u2018natural human emotions\u2019 aside and judge case on facts alone, Mandy says Mandy says it is clear to everyone in the court room that Ian Wilkinson is a \u201ckind and good person\u201d. He says this also applies to the three lunch guests who died. Human beings naturally feel deep empathy when confronted with events of loss, Mandy says. He says humans may have an instinctive reaction to seek retribution for someone whose actions have caused the death of others. \u201cWe know these actions of Erin Patterson caused the deaths of these three people and the serious illness of another\u201d he says. Mandy says jurors are judges and must guard against this type of thinking. \u201cYou have to put your natural human emotions \u2026 to one side.\u201d He says the case is about a criminal offence with elements that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. \u201cAs a judge, what\u2019s in your hearts, has no relevance at all,\u201d he says. Mandy says jurors must make a judgment on the facts alone. Mandy says an important issue in this case is whether it is possible for people to share the same meal, containing death cap mushrooms, and have \u201cvery different health outcomes\u201d. \u201cThe answer to that question is a fundamental part of the case,\u201d he says. Mandy says the prosecution \u201cseems to say \u2018not possible\u2019\u201d. Mandy says the prosecution should have called evidence if there was a medical reason Patterson did not become as unwell as her lunch guests. The jurors have returned to the court room in Morwell The court has adjourned for a lunch break Mandy\u2019s closing address will continue from 2.15pm. Mandy points to the \u201cimperfect\u201d evidence of nurse Kylie Ashton who told the trial the Patterson\u2019s children eating the beef wellington leftovers was first discussed at her initial presentation at Leongatha hospital. Mandy says this evidence was not supported by other medical witnesses and it was inconceivable doctors knew about the children at the initial presentation as they would have taken urgent action. He says the nurse may have found out about the children later and made a mistake when she testified. Mandy tells the jury that people have \u201cimperfect and honestly mistaken memories\u201d. He says the jurors will have experienced telling a story to a group of people and having it recounted differently. \u201cDetails get emphasised, details get minimised,\u201d he says. Patterson\u2019s defence lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, is delivering his closing address to the jury. He says the jury\u2019s consideration needs to come down to two issues. First, whether there is a reasonable possibility that death cap mushrooms were put into the beef wellingtons accidentally. Second, whether there is a reasonable possibility that Patterson did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to her guests. He says if either of these are a reasonable possibility the jury must find Patterson not guilty. \u201cThat\u2019s the law,\u201d he says. He says the prosecution has a \u201cflawed approach\u201d in analysing the evidence. \u201cThe prosecution has just made an argument. That\u2019s not evidence,\u201d he says. Mandy says the prosecution has selected parts of the evidence that suits their argument while \u201cdiscarding inconvenient truths\u201d. On Monday, Rogers told the jury that Patterson had made four calculated deceptions. She says Patterson has also played a \u201cfifth deception\u201d in her story she told the jury. Rogers says there are inconsistencies Patterson cannot account for so she ignores them or says witnesses, including her children, are wrong. \u201cFocus on the evidence,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember to combine all the evidence in this case.\u201d Rogers says this includes Patterson preparing and allocating the meal, that she was the only one who consumed the meal and did not fall seriously ill, familiarity with the citizen science website iNaturalist and the observation map for death cap mushrooms. She also points to cell tower evidence consistent with her phone being in the two locations in Gippsland where death cap mushrooms were seen and reported on iNaturalist in April and May 2023, photos of the mushrooms Patterson was dehydrating months before the lunch which are consistent in appearance with death cap mushrooms and remnants of death caps found in the dehydrator. \u201cWhen you consider all of the evidence in combination, we suggest, you will be satisfied that the accused deliberately sourced death caps and deliberately served death caps,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThose conclusions, we suggest, will lead you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of each of the four charges on the indictment.\u201d Rogers has concluded her closing address. Rogers says the jury should not let their emotional response to the events sway their verdict. \u201cYou must not feel sorry for the accused,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may not want to believe that anyone is capable of what the accused has done \u2026 you might not understand it.\u201d \u201cBut look at the evidence. Don\u2019t let your emotional reaction dictate your verdict.\u201d Rogers says there is no reasonable alternative other than Pattrson deliberating sourcing death cap mushrooms and deliberating putting them in the beef wellingtons. She says after the lunch Patterson told multiple lies. \u201cShe\u2019s told lies upon lies because she knew the truth would implicate,\u201d she says. Rogers reminds the jury that Patterson has no legal obligation to prove anything in the trial. She stresses that parts of Patterson\u2019s story, including her history of foraging wild mushrooms between 2020 and 2023, are based solely on her own evidence. She says binge eating and purging, vomiting after the fateful lunch and stopping to go to the toilet in a bush the day after the beef wellington meal, also fall in this category. \u201cThe prosecution says you cannot accept the accused as a truthful, trustworthy witness,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cYou should reject her evidence.\u201d Rogers turns to lies Patterson has told These include not owning a dehydrator and not foraging for mushrooms. Rogers says there are also lies Patterson had told but not admitted to. She says Patterson lied when she testified she invited her guests to the beef wellington meal because she had had an enjoyable lunch with Don and Gail the month prior. The evidence shows Patterson indicated the lunch was to discuss a medical issue, Rogers says. She tells the jury Patterson also lied when she testified that she never told the lunch guests she had a cancer diagnosis. She says Patterson herself said she discussed cancer treatment at the lunch. \u201cThat does not happen without a diagnosis,\u201d Rogers says. She says the \u201cstarkest lie\u201d was when Patterson testified she was planning to have gastric bypass surgery in 2023. Rogers reminds the jury of evidence that the clinic where Patterson said she had a pre-surgery appointment has never offered this procedure. Rogers says the jury may wonder why Patterson shared photos of her dehydrator with her online friend if she planned to use it to dehydrate death cap mushrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly easy to identify where she went wrong when you look back,\u201d she says. But she says the jury should ensure their assessment is based on the evidence of this case. \u201cI suggest to you, the accused did think she would get away with these crimes and she never suspected doctors would so quickly assume death cap mushrooms were involved,\u201d Rogers says. \u2018What would you do?,\u2019 prosecutor asks jury Rogers asks the jury to imagine what they would do if they were in Patterson\u2019s position. \u201cIf you were told the meal you had served and cooked your family possibly had death cap mushrooms, what would you do?\u201d she asks. Rogers says they would not go into self preservation mode, be reluctant to receive medical treatment or take 2.5 hours to \u201ceventually agree\u201d to get their children medically assessed. \u201cYou would do everything you could to help the people you love. You would tell the treating medical practitioners every skerrick of information,\u201d she says. Rogers says the defence will probably argue there are innocent explanations of Patterson\u2019s actions like discharging herself from the hospital within minutes of arriving, being reluctant to get her children medically tested and dumping the dehydrator. Rogers plays the jury CCTV footage of medical staff trying to stop Patterson from discharging herself from Leongtha hospital on 31 July 2023. She says Patterson told police she needed to leave the hospital to organise things for her children and animals. But Rogers says she had already dropped her children at the bus stop for school. She says there were other ways she could have managed her children and animals given she had been warned she may have ingested a fatal toxin. Rogers says the jury should reject suggestions by the defence that Patterson dumped the dehydrator because she panicked \u201cPanic does not explain the extensive and prolonged efforts that the accused went to in order to cover up what she had done,\u201d she says. Patterson continued to lie even when the lives of her lunch guests were at stake, Rogers says. Rogers says what Patterson \u201coutwardly\u201d portrayed did not always align with her \u201ctrue feelings\u201d. She says Simon gave evidence that when he told her his parents were in hospital the day after the lunch Patterson never asked about them. If Patterson loved her in-laws she would have immediately asked about their welfare, Rogers says. Relationship with in-laws not always \u2018harmonious\u2019 Rogers turns to Patterson\u2019s relationship with her parents-in-law. She says Patterson\u2019s estranged husband, Simon Patterson, told the jury Patterson seemed to love his parents. \u201cOn the surface it seemed that way, even to the family members themselves,\u201d Rogers says. But she says the jury has heard evidence Patterson\u2019s relationship with her in-laws, Don and Gail, was not always \u201charmonious\u201d. She reminds the jury about evidence regarding Patterson and Simon\u2019s dispute over child support payments. She says Simon and Patterson\u2019s son described his parents\u2019 relationship as negative before the lunch. Rogers says Patterson expressed her real feelings about her parents in-law and the broader family with her online friends. She says in messages from December 2022, seen by the jury, Patterson called her parents-in-law a \u201clost cause\u201d. Rogers says Patterson deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms. \u201cShe knew exactly what she was looking for and she targeted her search accordingly,\u201d she says. Rogers says the defence will probably argue that Patterson had a good relationship with her lunch guests. She reminds the jury that they do not need to know why someone did something to know that they did it. Rogers tells the jury not to become distracted by the issue of a lack of motive. \u201cThe question is not why she did this. The question you have to determine is has the prosecution determined, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did this deliberately?,\u201d she says. Rogers says she expects the defence will argue the jury cannot exclude the possibility that Patterson \u201cinnocently\u201d foraged for wild mushrooms and accidentally picked death cap mushrooms. \u201cWas the accused really a mushroom forager between 2020 and 2023 as she claimed to you?,\u201d Rogers asks rhetorically. She says the only evidence about this \u201ccomes from her own evidence\u201d. \u201cNone of the immediate family members you heard from in this trial \u2026 knew the accused to pick or eat wild mushrooms.\u201d Rogers says Patterson\u2019s two children were unaware of her foraging despite living with her during this period. \u201cThe accused never discussed foraging for mushrooms with her online friends \u2026 even though they discussed absolutely everything.\u201d Rogers reminds the jury about the evidence about four factory resets conducted on Phone B. She says Phone B, which Patterson handed to police, was a \u201cdummy phone\u201d, with the sim card only inserted into it two days before police searched her home \u201cThis was not her usual phone number,\u201d she says. \u201cWe say she lied about her phone number in the police interview.\u201d Rogers says the multiple factory resets, handing over a \u201cdummy\u201d phone and claiming she had a different phone number was \u201cdesigned to frustrate the police investigation of this matter\u201d. \u201cIt was all done so police would never see the contents of the accused\u2019s mobile phone,\u201d she says. Rogers says the only reasonable explanation for this deceptive content is that Patterson knew the contents on phone A would implicate her in the deaths of the lunch guess. \u201cThis is another example of incriminating conduct,\u201d Rogers says. Patterson\u2019s mobile phones Rogers turns to evidence about Patterson\u2019s mobile phones. She says Patterson had a change in handset at the beginning of February. She continued to use this phone \u2013 Phone A \u2013 until after the lunch. \u201cThis is what the prosecution says is the accused\u2019s usual mobile phone,\u201d Rogers says. She says Phone A was still in use up to and while police were searching Patterson\u2019s house on 5 August 2023. Rogers reminds the jury the agreed fact that at an unknown time between 12.01pm and 1.45pm on this day Patterson\u2019s original phone number \u2013 previously used for Phone A \u2013 \u201clost connection with the network\u201d. Rogers says this could be due to: A. The sim card being removed B. The battery being removed without the handset being off C. The handset being damaged Rogers says for any of these three things to occur someone \u2013 \u201cand we say the accused\u201d \u2013 must have been handling the mobile phone. She reminds the jury that to this day police have never located Phone A. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC is continuing to deliver her closing address. She says the day after Patterson was discharged from Monash hospital in August 2023 she drove to a local tip, Koonwarra Transfer Station And Landfill, and dumped the food dehydrator because she \u201cknew it would incriminate her\u201d. She says the only reason Patterson did this was to cover up the deadly meal. \u201cShe wanted to hide the evidence,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThis is another example of incriminating conduct. \u201cShe knew that keeping it would be far too risky.\u201d Rogers says that if police had not discovered the transaction from the tip then Patterson\u2019s disposal of the dehydrator would not have come to light. \u201cErin Patterson certainly wasn\u2019t telling anybody about it,\u201d she says. Rogers says Patterson lied to police when asked if she owned a dehydrator in the formal interview. The jurors have returned to the court room in Morwell. Here\u2019s a recap of the what jury heard on Monday: Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC told the jury Erin Patterson made \u201cfour calculated deceptions\u201d. She said these were fabricating a cancer claim as a reason to host the lunch, secreting a lethal dose of poison in the beef wellingtons, her attempts to pretend she was also sick, and a sustained cover-up to \u201cconceal the truth\u201d after the lunch. Patterson did not think she would be questioned about her cancer claim because she believed her \u201clie would die with them [her lunch guests]\u201d, Rogers said. Rogers told the jury to reject Patterson\u2019s evidence that there were no grey plates she served the beef wellingtons on. She said Ian Wilkinson, the sole surviving lunch guest, was a \u201ccompelling witness\u201d and recalled four grey plates. He said Patterson ate off an orange-tan coloured plate. Not one medical professional who saw Patterson said she looked unwell, Rogers told the jury. Patterson\u2019s initial reluctance to have her children medically tested, after she told medical staff she fed them leftovers of the fatal meal, was because she knew they had not consumed death cap mushrooms, Rogers said. Welcome to day 33 of Erin Patterson\u2019s triple murder trial. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC will continue delivering her closing address to jurors this morning. Patterson\u2019s defence lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, will then address the jury. We\u2019re expecting the trial to resume from 10.30am. Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to a beef wellington lunch she served at her house in Leongatha, in regional Victoria, on 29 July 2023. She is accused of murdering her in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, and her estranged husband\u2019s aunt, Heather Wilkinson. The attempted murder charge relates to Heather\u2019s husband, Ian. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution alleges Patterson deliberately poisoned her lunch guests with \u201cmurderous intent\u201d, but her lawyers say the poisoning was a tragic accident.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jun/17/australia-mushroom-trial-live-erin-patterson-triple-murder-closing-arguments-ntwnfb", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Mandy says Patterson only disposed of the dehydrator after the meal.

As the conflict between Iran and Israel has heated up in the days since Israel\u2019s surprise attack last week, a consensus has emerged that, while Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions have been severely compromised, it is all but impossible for Israel to extinguish them permanently without American support. Nonetheless, Israel hopes that scuttling Iran\u2019s nuclear talks with the US and severely weakening the regime as a military threat will make its gambit worthwhile. And there is another goal that Benjamin Netanyahu appears to believe is possible: regime change. That phrase, associated as it is with the US-led coalition\u2019s disastrous military adventure in Iraq, is something of a taboo in western capitals. But Netanyahu has been publicly bullish about the end of Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s rule: \u201cI can tell you this, we have indications that senior leaders in Iran are already packing their bags,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cThey sense what\u2019s coming.\u201d In other statements, Netanyahu has been more ambiguous \u2013 and there are good reasons to think that Israel\u2019s attacks, extending yesterday to Iran\u2019s state broadcaster, may have the opposite effect. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House, about what Israel really wants, and why a sudden transformation in Tehran still looks very unlikely. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Grooming gangs | A culture of \u201cblindness, ignorance and prejudice\u201d led to repeated failures over decades to properly investigate cases in which children were abused by grooming gangs, a report has said. Louise Casey said that the authorities had shied away from collecting data on the ethnicity of perpetrators. Gaza | At least 37 Palestinians were killed on Monday in new shootings near food distribution centres run by private US contractors, local authorities said. The death toll, blamed by witnesses on Israeli troops, was the highest yet reported in the near-daily shootings since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations three weeks ago. India | Investigators are preparing to study the pilots\u2019 last words for clues as to the cause of the Air India plane crash, after recovering the cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage. The voice recorder was in the Boeing 787 aircraft\u2019s second black box, which Indian authorities said they had found on Sunday. Carers | The mother of a teenager with cerebral palsy has demanded an end to the \u201csickening harassment\u201d of unpaid carers after a significant legal victory against the government. Nicola Green was pursued by the Department for Work and Pensions for more than a year after she was accused of fraudulently claiming nearly \u00a33,000 in carer\u2019s allowance. UK news | A second person who died in a tandem skydiving incident in Devon has been identified as Adam Harrison, 30, from Bournemouth. Emergency services were called to the area around Dunkeswell aerodrome on Friday. Harrison, who was a tandem skydive instructor, and Belinda Taylor, 48, from Totnes, were confirmed dead at the scene. In depth: \u2018At best, they can try to weaken the regime and let the dominoes fall\u2019 In much of the discussion around the \u201cexistential threat\u201d that Israel says it faces from Iran, the focus has been on the risk of Tehran developing nuclear weapons. Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that nuclear weapons and Iran\u2019s existing ballistic missiles were the primary targets of the Israeli operation. But his comments have also left plenty of space to ask whether there is another goal: the removal of the Iranian regime. Israel acted \u201cto not only protect ourselves, but protect the world from this incendiary regime\u201d, he said. And after the first wave of attacks, he called for \u201cthe Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime\u201d. So is that a serious aim \u2013 and what might Iran\u2019s future look like if it happened? *** Does Israel want regime change in Iran? There is little doubt that it \u201cwould be a dreamlike scenario for the Israeli political establishment\u201d, Sanam Vakil said. But there is a difference between a dream outcome and a realistic strategic goal. \u201cSince the 7 October attacks, there has been a consensus in Israel that Iran has to be cut down to size. But privately, military and intelligence officials tend to see regime change itself as very hard to achieve.\u201d What is less clear is what Netanyahu and his political allies really want, or believe to be feasible. \u201cSeeing Iran as the primary security threat and enemy of Israel is something he\u2019s spoken about for two decades,\u201d Vakil said. His foreign policy has generally focused on containment rather than direct confrontation \u2013 but that is partly because previous US presidents, and even Trump in his first term, have been less tolerant of Israeli aggression than the White House now appears. \u201cSince October 7, Israel\u2019s calculations have shifted, and it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about this now. At best, they can try to weaken the regime and let the dominoes fall.\u201d Some analysts have voiced the view that while it suits Israel to call for regime change now, as a way to destabilise Iran, it is less clear that it would be its preferred outcome in reality. In an X post that she acknowledged presented an \u201cincreasingly unpopular opinion\u201d, Maryam Alemzadeh, a professor of Iranian politics at Oxford, argued that Israel \u201cwants a hardliner state who tries to retaliate and make Israel the victim, but fails to inflict much damage\u201d. She said that regime change would ultimately mean that \u201cIran as the straw man enemy that Israel relies on would disappear\u201d. *** Has Israel\u2019s attack changed the views of ordinary Iranians? On its face, Netanyahu\u2019s appeal to the Iranian people would appear to suggest that he hopes the instability created by Israel\u2019s attacks will stoke the already significant discontent in Iran \u2013 and bring about a popular uprising. In a country of more than 90 million people who have limited opportunities for public expression, it is obviously foolish to claim knowledge of what \u201cthe Iranian people\u201d want. \u201cI don\u2019t have a handle on the diversity of views in Iran, and I doubt that Israel does, either,\u201d Vakil said. But it is perhaps more likely that the attacks will have the opposite effect. The Iranian health ministry claims that 90% of casualties so far are civilians; the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, has threatened that \u201cthe residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon\u201d for Iranian retaliation against Israeli residential areas. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t play well in Iran,\u201d Vakil said. \u201cThere is, perhaps, an arrogance in asking people who have long been suppressed by their government to come out and topple the regime in response to an Israeli attack.\u201d This piece by William Christou and Deepa Parent, reporting on emergency admissions to a Tehran hospital, gives a sense of how unconvincing a messenger Israel is now likely to appear to many Iranians. In general, Iranians have not appeared supportive of their government\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance\u201d anti-Israel strategy in recent years. But now there may well be a \u201crebound effect\u201d, Vakil said: \u201cWhat Israel and Netanyahu are doing is creating more antipathy among a civilian population that wasn\u2019t very animated about Israel at all.\u201d *** Could Israel topple the regime without Iranian civilian support? Set aside the slim prospects of a sudden popular uprising: Israel might also hope that its attacks will precipitate the regime\u2019s removal by other means. And, Vakil said, the Islamic republic has clearly been weakened by Israel\u2019s attack: \u201cThis could certainly be the beginning of a transformation, and you can imagine a domino effect that leads to new people at the top.\u201d But while Israel\u2019s success in killing senior military leaders has shocked the Iranian establishment, there was little impact on civilian and clerical leadership. In any case, Vakil said, the Iranian state is not so shaky that the loss of individuals would be likely to precipitate a wholesale change. \u201cThe symbolism of taking out the top echelon of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps], which is enshrined in the Iranian constitution as the protector against external and internal threats, is not lost on people. It reveals a system that can not manage its own security. \u201cIt is important and deeply traumatic and embarrassing for the Islamic republic, but it would be a little too triumphant to think that it means the regime is going to collapse as a result.\u201d There is another problem: the vector of the Israeli assault. The historic evidence of regime change brought about through war suggests that it is rarely the result of aerial attack alone, Vakil said. \u201cUnless the United States suddenly decides that it wants to roll in with boots on the ground, and that it is prepared to engage in a military operation like the one in Iraq, it is very hard to see the Islamic republic being toppled overnight.\u201d *** Would the death of Ayatollah Khamenei change that? On Sunday, Reuters reported a remarkable claim from senior US administration officials: that Israel had a plan to kill the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but that it was vetoed by the White House. If such an operation had been successful \u2013 the same report said that Israel believed it had an opportunity to take Khamenei out \u2013 the rupture to Iran\u2019s political structures would clearly have been even more profound. But, Vakil said, Iran is not like Iraq under Saddam Hussein or Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, where so much power was vested in a single person that their removal could be expected to bring about a fundamental change. \u201cPower in Iran is institutionalised, not personalised,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a massive blow, of course. But the regime would quickly convene and decide what to do.\u201d One good reason to be sceptical that Khamenei\u2019s removal would be transformative: Iran is already planning for a future without the 86-year-old. Under the pressure of international sanctions, there has been little public discussion of succession, Vakil said: \u201cPart of why the regime had agreed to negotiate with Trump is that they wanted to create the space for that process to play out in the public domain.\u201d *** What might a new regime look like? In this thread on X on Saturday, Vakil laid out some scenarios that might unfold, ranging from a sectarian civil war with a power vacuum at the centre to a coup by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. A pluralistic democracy does not make the list. \u201cIt\u2019s not readily apparent that it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d she said, as there is no organised opposition in Tehran, while the exiled opposition has few friends at home. \u201cEven among the diaspora, there are so many opinions about what a revolutionary regime change moment should look like. And within the country there is paralysis. You can confidently say that the majority of the country is deeply unhappy with the leadership of the Islamic republic \u2013 but I don\u2019t have a sense that Iranians can articulate a coherent view of what they want instead.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Over the past five days, the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, which commemorates those who have died of the disease, has been viewed by thousands of deeply moved people at London\u2019s Tate Modern \u2013 revealing it to be, argues Charlie Porter, one of the most significant artworks of the past 40 years.

Donald Trump has denied that he left a G7 leaders summit in Canada early to work on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran in a social media post in which he also derided Emmanuel Macron as \u201cpublicity seeking\u201d. Trump said the French president had \u201cno idea\u201d why he was returning to Washington and that the reason was \u201cmuch bigger\u201d than a ceasefire.

Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned! The Israeli military claims it destroyed \u201cdozens of ground-to-ground missile storage and launch facilities, as well as ground-to-air missile launchers\u201d in western Iran overnight. In a post on X it added: Air Force fighter jets completed several waves of strikes last night targeting dozens of military targets of the Iranian regime in western Iran. It was not possible to verify the claim. As we reported earlier, one target of Israeli strikes on Monday night was the state broadcaster. Journalists are considered civilians under international humanitarian law and deliberately targeting them is a war crime. Here\u2019s our latest gallery from the Israel-Iran conflict: A couple of images have come in on the wires showing heavy traffic out of Tehran overnight. The photos show the Karaj-Chalus road with vehicles moving westwards out of the Iranian capital. US President Donald Trump told Iranians to \u201cimmediately evacuate\u201d the capital in a post on social media earlier, not long after Israel told people to evacuate a large part of Tehran ahead of a bombing campaign \u2013 similar to its tactics in Gaza where it has killed tens of thousands of civilians. Two Filipino nationals are being treated in hospital in Israel, including a woman who is in critical condition, following Iran\u2019s retaliatory air strikes. The woman, who is being treated in intensive care at the Shamir Medical Center in central Israel, sustained severe injuries to her heart and lungs, according to the Philippines Embassy in Tel Aviv. Hans Cacdac, secretary of the department of migrant workers, told the Philippine broadcaster GMA she was conscious but remained in critical condition. According to local media, eight Filipino nationals have been injured in Israel, with six now discharged from hospital. \u201cWe are doing everything within our means to reach and assist our nationals affected by this crisis,\u201d said Philippine ambassador to Israel Aileen Mendiola. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, especially our kababayan [fellow Filipino] who is now fighting for her life. We ask the Filipino community to join us in praying for her survival and healing.\u201d Officials from the department of migrant workers are assisting 14 Filipinos affected by the conflict, including by providing temporary accommodations, GMA reported. At least 109 migrant Filipinos had requested repatriation following the escalation in conflict. There are about 30,000 Filipino nationals working in Israel, including many who are employed as carers.

Planet Labs have released images from before and after Israel\u2019s strikes on the Tabriz north missile base in Iran: G7 leaders have affirmed that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself\u201d and that \u201cWe reiterate our support for the security of Israel,\u201d in a statement in which they called Iran \u201cthe principal source of regional instability and terror\u201d. Israel launched a shock attack on Iran on Friday, as Washington and Tehran were in the midst of nuclear negotiations, and has so far killed more than 200 people, mostly civilians and many of them children, Iran says. Retaliatory strikes by Iran have killed 24 people, all of them civilians, Israel says. Earlier reports had said US President Donald Trump refused to sign a statement that called for restraint, de-escalation and diplomacy. The statement in full: We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East. In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. We also affirm the importance of the protection of civilians. Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror. We have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza. We will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability. Five Palestinian civilians have been killed and several others injured after Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid in north-west Gaza city on Monday evening, Palestinian news agency Wafa reports. It was not possible to independently verify the report as Israel does not allow foreign reporters into the occupied territory. The latest massacre comes after 37 people were killed in shootings near food distribution centres run by private US contractors guarded by Israeli troops earlier on Monday, the highest yet reported in the near-daily shootings since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations three weeks ago. Citing medical sources, Wafa said the number of Palestinians killed while seeking aid had now reached 338, with 2,831 wounded since 27 May. Watch French President Emmanuel Macron speaking at the G7: As we reported earlier Democrats in Washington have moved to reassert congressional authority over US military engagement in the Middle East amid fears of American involvement. Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator of Virginia, on Monday introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit US armed forces from taking direct action against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress or a declaration of war. \u201cI am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,\u201d Kaine said in a statement. \u201cThe American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation\u2019s men and women in uniform into harm\u2019s way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.\u201d The measure, like other attempts to claw back power from the executive branch, faces a steep climb in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans have been mostly unwilling to challenge Donald Trump\u2019s authority. \u201cIf diplomacy fails ... help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs, fly with them if necessary,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. However some Republicans have supported the move. \u201cThis is not our war. But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.,\u201d Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky said on X. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has told Fox News that Donald Trump still wants a nuclear deal with Iran, just hours after the US president told residents of Tehran to \u201cimmediately evacuate\u201d. \u201cOf course,\u201d Hegseth said on Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters Primetime show when asked if Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cHis position has not changed\u201d. He continued: What you\u2019re watching in real time, is peace through strength and America First \u2026 We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that\u2019s what happens here ... President Trump has made it clear it [a deal] is on the table, the question is whether Iran will take it. He insisted Israel\u2019s shock attack on Iran on Friday \u2013 which came amid US and Iranian negotiations on a nuclear deal \u2013 was \u201cself-defence\u201d. Fox earlier reported that Trump had directed national security staff to convene in the situation room after leaving the G7 leaders summit in Canada early. US media reported that secretary of state Marco Rubio has also left the summit early. Donald Trump has encouraged vice president JD Vance and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to offer to meet the Iranians this week, the New York Times has reported, citing a US official. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi had earlier indicated that Tehran was open to negotiations, also suggesting Trump could stop the war with \u201cone phone call\u201d to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. In a post on X he wrote: If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential. Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy. French President Emmanuel Macron has claimed Donald Trump is considering the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and said that an attempt to overthrow the Iranian regime would be a \u201cstrategic error\u201d. Macron told reporters at the G7: There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions \u2026 We have to see now whether the sides will follow. Macron described Trump\u2019s early exit as a positive development. Right now I believe negotiations need to restart and that civilians need to be protected. He added that he didn\u2019t believe things would change in the next few hours, but \u201csince the US assured they will find a ceasefire and since they can pressure Israel, things may change\u201d. Macron called on both Israel and Iran to \u201cend\u201d strikes against civilians and warned that aiming to overthrow Tehran\u2019s clerical state would be a \u201cstrategic error.\u201d He said: All who have thought that by bombing from the outside you can save a country in spite of itself have always been mistaken. Trump told reporters he had to leave early for \u201cobvious reasons\u201d. Throughout the day he repeated his mantra that Iran must never possess a nuclear weapon, an ambition Iran denies, but which Israel insists is Tehran\u2019s true and imminent objective. The stream of wounded in Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran had been steady since Friday. On Sunday evening it became a flood. A renewed wave of Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s capital overwhelmed the hospital\u2019s emergency unit, turning it into what one doctor described as a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. \u201cIt was a bloodbath. We were overwhelmed by chaos and the screams of grieving family members. Dozens upon dozens of people with life-threatening injuries, minor wounds and even bodies were brought in,\u201d a doctor at the emergency unit of the hospital told the Guardian on Monday under condition of anonymity. As fighting between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day, Iranian hospitals were receiving a surge of wounded people, overwhelming medical facilities and exhausted personnel. Medical staff described scenes of bloody chaos and an influx of injured people that has only seemed to grow as Israeli strikes increased in intensity. \u201cI\u2019ve seen toddlers, teenagers, adults and the elderly alike. Profusely bleeding mothers were rushing in with their children injured by shrapnel,\u201d the doctor said, adding that some parents did not realise they themselves were injured until they put their children down. They rattled off a list of injuries: metal lodged in femur bones and the soft tissues of the hip joints, internal bleeding and severe burns. Many of those wounded had been nearby when an Israeli bomb dropped, peppering them with deadly shrapnel. A staffer at the Iranian state broadcaster IRIB has died after an Israeli attack on the building during a live broadcast, Iranian media has reported. Masoumeh Azimi succumbed to severe injuries caused by the shockwave from the attack, Press TV, which is owned by IRIB, reported. Several other journalists were also injured, it said. It was not possible to independently confirm the report. Iranian newsreader Sahar Emami was showered with rubble and her studio filled with dust live on air when the strike hit the broadcaster. Footage showed the newsreader fleeing from her desk late on Monday. The station later said its building was hit by four bombs. Iran condemned the attack on a state television building in Tehran as a war crime, and called on the UN to take action. The strike was a \u201cwicked act\u201d and a \u201cwar crime\u201d, said a foreign ministry spokesperson. \u201cThe UN [security council] must act now to stop the genocidal aggressor from committing further atrocities against our people.\u201d Journalists are considered civilians under international humanitarian law and deliberately targeting them is a war crime. After the strike, Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz wrote on X, \u201cThe propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority of the Iranian regime was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of nearby residents. Strike the Iranian dictator everywhere.\u201d \u201cYou probably see what I see and I have to be back as soon as I can,\u201d Donald Trump said in an apparent nod to the intensifying conflict in the Middle East, when asked why he\u2019s cutting short his G7 trip and heading back to Washington tonight. President Trump has directed national security staff to convene in the situation room, both CNN and Fox News are reporting, citing a White House official. Trump will be leaving the G7 Summit in Canada early. There are few other details available. US defence ministry spokespeople have denied reports online that the US has joined attacks on Iran. \u201cThis is not true\u201d, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote on X in response to one such post. In another, he wrote: American Forces are maintaining their defensive posture &amp; that has not changed. We will protect American troops &amp; our interests. Hours before Trump\u2019s post about evacuating Tehran, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed that he had ordered the deployment of \u201cadditional capabilities\u201d to the Middle East. Hegseth did not disclose what military capabilities he sent to the region. But Reuters was the first to report earlier on Monday a deployment of a large number of US military refueling aircraft and the movement of an aircraft carrier to the Middle East. In a post on social media Hegseth wrote: Protecting US forces is our top priority and these deployments are intended to enhance our defensive posture in the region. Moments after Donald Trump\u2019s social media post telling Tehran\u2019s 9 million residents to evacuate, the White House announced he was leaving the G7 leaders summit in Canada early citing the situation in the Middle East. \u201cMuch was accomplished, but because of what\u2019s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X. Trump was originally supposed to arrive back in the US in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to people familiar with the matter. Donald Trump has said \u201cEveryone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\u201d hours after Israel issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran on Monday. \u201cIran should have signed the \u201cdeal\u201d I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!,\u201d the US president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. Washington and Tehran had been in the midst of nuclear negotiations when Israel launched its shock attack on Iran on Friday. Tehran has a population of about 9 million and it\u2019s currently just after 4am. Hours before Trump\u2019s comments Israeli forces had issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran, warning them of the imminent bombing of \u201cmilitary infrastructure\u201d in the area in a social media post very similar to those regularly directed at Palestinians in Gaza over the past 20 months. The post on X was from the account of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Arabic spokesperson, Col Avichay Adraee. It is a further sign of the evolving nature of the Israeli campaign against Iran, which began with attacks on air defences, nuclear sites and the military chain of command, but appears to have drifted towards a war of attrition focused on Iran\u2019s oil and gas industry and on the capital. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East. Donald Trump has said \u201cEveryone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\u201d even as French President Emmanuel Macron said his US counterpart had made an offer for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. \u201cThere is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions,\u201d Macron told reporters at the G7. \u201cWe have to see now whether the sides will follow.\u201d Macron\u2019s remark came only an hour after Trump issued his evacuation warning, adding in a post on his social media platform Truth Social \u201cIran should have signed the \u2018deal\u2019 I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life.\u201d Moments later the White House announced Trump was leaving the G7 leaders meeting in Canada early, citing the situation in the Middle East. Washington and Tehran had been in the midst of nuclear negotiations when Israel launched its shock attack on Iran on Friday. Trump\u2019s comments came hours after Israel issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran. Iran and Israel have exchanged waves of missiles since Friday. Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, all of them civilians. In other developments: Israel indicated that its attacks on Iran are unfinished, and that it would not rule out targeting the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in interviews with US media today. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Associated Press that Israeli strikes have set Iran\u2019s nuclear program back a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d and he would \u201cnot be surprised\u201d if the attacks toppled the Iranian government. Speaking on ABC News, Netanyahu added that killing Khamenei would not \u201cescalate the conflict\u201d but rather \u201cend it.\u201d On social media, Israel\u2019s foreign minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar wrote that he had told the European Union\u2019s foreign minister Kaja Kallas that its military operation in Iran was unfinished and that \u201cIsrael will act to complete it.\u201d Meanwhile, Iran said its counter-attacks on Israel were self-defense and appealed to Gulf State leaders for aid asking Donald Trump to help negotiate a ceasefire with Israel. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations told the body\u2019s Security Council that its strikes on Israel are \u201cproportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure\u201d, Reuters reports. Iranian officials have also asked the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to mediate discussions with the United States, Reuters reports. The United States has relocated refueling aircraft to Europe in order to give Donald Trump military options as hostilities escalate between Iran and Israel, Reuters reports. Reuters and the New York Times also report that the USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrrier, is en route to the Middle East as part of a planned deployment. The news comes even as US senator Tim Kaine introduced legislation to restrict Donald Trump\u2019s war powers. Group of Seven leaders drafted a joint statement calling for de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, according to two sources and a draft seen by Reuters. The draft commits to safeguarding market stability, including energy markets, and says Israel has the right to defend itself. Donald Trump does not intend to sign the statement, CBS News reports, citing unnamed US officials. European countries have begun evacuating their citizens from Israel. Germany will evacuate its citizens via Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, with a charter flight scheduled for Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK is establishing a system for UK nationals to register their presence in Israel.

Earlier this month, Johnston informed two students that they had been terminated and two that they were suspended after taking part in a pro-Palestine demonstration at an academic\u2019s office last October, prompting concern from some academics and the Greens. The letter, sent by the HRLC legal director, Sarah Schwartz, who is also the executive officer at the pro-Palestinian Jewish Council of Australia, on Tuesday expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the university\u2019s decision. As a public authority, the university has clear obligations under the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities to act compatibly with human rights, and to give due consideration to those rights in all decisions. The university\u2019s commitment to rights and freedoms is recognised in its many policies. It should also comply with international human rights norms, given the university\u2019s global standing and reach. In our view, the response of the university in these cases is neither compatible with the Charter nor with international human rights norms. In addition to the severe harm to the individual students, this decision will have a chilling and stigmatising effect on protest, intellectual and student life on campus.\u201d Johnston told Guardian Australia the university respected the rights of individuals to protest, reiterating \u201cthis has not changed\u201d. Universities are places where free and open debate must take place, but the safety of our students and staff must also be protected as this is integral to enabling free and open debate. Dfat says Indo-Pacific can \u2018count on\u2019 Australia as it pivots more aid to region \u201cWe\u2019re stepping up where others are stepping back,\u201d the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) says. The Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) this week revealed the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s and Elon Musk\u2019s department of government efficiency\u2019s gutting of US foreign aid. Australian non-government organisations and their partners took a $400m hit, and at least 20 offices have closed, with devastating flow-on effects on the delivery of health, education and climate change support. Acfid wants the government to increase foreign aid spending from 0.65% of the budget to 1%. A Dfat spokesperson said on Tuesday that the region could \u201ccount on\u201d Australia as a partner, as it pivots more aid to the region. They said: Recognising the impact of global aid cuts, we have reprioritised our development assistance to dedicate 75c of every Australian development dollar to support the Indo-Pacific next year. We\u2019ve also reprioritised global funding this year to meet immediate needs in the Pacific, Southeast Asia and South Asia as a result of global aid cuts. We have also provided temporary additional flexibility to Australian NGOs to mitigate the impacts of some of the cuts on local partners in the Indo-Pacific. The Greens support Acfid\u2019s call to increase aid to at least 1%. Deputy leader, Mehreen Faruqi, said Australia should show leadership, and bears \u201cultimate responsibility for the adequacy and stability of our aid program\u201d. She said: Trump\u2019s callous aid freeze and funding cuts are devastating the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities and the Albanese government is letting them get away with it.

Former NSW premier Nick Greiner will chair a new committee in charge of the state Liberal branch after the panel installed after the council elections bungle was dumped. The Liberal party\u2019s federal executive voted to create the new committee at a meeting in Canberra on Tuesday, extending a federal intervention into the branch for another nine months. The federal executive was also considering who to appoint to lead two separate reviews after the party\u2019s worst federal election result in its 80-year history. The party\u2019s peak administrative body launched an intervention into the NSW branch in September after the local government election nominations fiasco, installing an administrative committee to run the division for 10 months. Victorian Liberal elders Alan Stockdale and Richard Alston and former NSW state MP Peta Seaton were charged with reviewing the party\u2019s constitution, overhauling the administrative machinery and helping to conduct the federal election campaign. The term was due to expire on 30 June, creating an early test for the new Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, as the competing factions in her home state wrangled over the future of the division. The federal executive had the option to extend the committee\u2019s term or end the intervention, handing control back to the NSW division. A third option emerged in recent weeks, in which a federal-backed committee would remain in place but the current members would be replaced with NSW figures. The internal push to replace the committee members gathered momentum after the 80-year-old Stockdale said Liberal women were \u201csufficiently assertive\u201d and perhaps male candidates needed a leg up. Seaton will remain on the new committee. More on death cap mushrooms: scientists warn some deadly fungi look like supermarket varieties New South Wales and South Australia residents have been warned to stay away from wild mushrooms after a surge in the detection of highly poisonous death caps, including in Sydney. Amanita phalloides, commonly known as death cap mushrooms, have been found growing in Sydney, the southern highlands, southern NSW and the Adelaide hills after high rainfall, health officials say. It is estimated that half a death cap mushroom can kill an adult, and the species has caused 90% of the world\u2019s mushroom-related fatalities. The chief scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Prof Brett Summerell, said some poisonous varieties could look \u201cjust like a mushroom you\u2019d buy from the supermarket\u201d, making them extremely dangerous to forage.

Marles said yesterday Australia\u2019s military contingent was now \u201cmore relevant to [the] great power contest now than [it has] ever been before\u201d. Keating wrote in a long statement: Yesterday\u2019s statement by defence minister Richard Marles that Australia\u2019s geography and continent would be crucial to any United States prosecution of a war against China will go down as a dark moment in Australia\u2019s history. A moment when an Australian Labor government intellectually ceded Australia to the United States as a platform for the US and, by implication, Australia, for military engagement against the Chinese state in response to a threat China is alleged to be making. And ceding the continent to the United States devoid of an electoral authority \u2013 a month after an election where the government had the opportunity \u2013 but declined to make explicit, its strategic intentions and policies. Keating went on to say Marles\u2019 remarks amount to \u201cnothing more than a careless betrayal of the country\u2019s policy agency and independence in its ability to make decisions in its own national interest and not in the interest or interests of another country\u201d. NSW police say crime taskforce leading to arrests, guns off the streets after Auburn shooting The head of NSW police\u2019s taskforce into violent crime in Sydney said the body\u2019s work has already resulted in arrests and gun seizures after the lunchtime shooting of three people at a kebab shop in the suburb of Auburn yesterday. Detective superintendent Jason Box addressed concerns about public safety at a press conference earlier: Taskforce Falcon, with over 150 police, has been saturating places of interest and speaking to persons of interest. We\u2019ve warned people about their safety. We\u2019ve made arrests and recovered firearms from the street. We will keep putting forward our concerns for every offender that we arrest that\u2019s connected to these organised crime networks. You know, this conflict and this violence is something that we\u2019re trying to suppress, and every time there is an incident and we arrest someone, we\u2019re putting forward our concerns for these people not to be on the streets. And it\u2019s quite obvious that they shouldn\u2019t be. Queensland police have confirmed human remains found near the state\u2019s Good Night Scrub national park are those of missing teenager Pheobe Bishop. The remains were found during a search of the area on 6 June. Police charged Bishop\u2019s housemates with her murder earlier this month, with officials alleging they killed her before moving her body from the national park. James Wood, 34, and Tanika Bromley, 33, remain behind bars on individual charges of murder and two counts each of interfering with a corpse. Their next court appearance is set for 11 August. Investigations are ongoing and police are still appealing for information about her movements and those of a grey Hyundai IX35 between 15 May and 18 May in the greater Gin Gin area. Pacific faces \u2018critical moment\u2019 in fight for press freedom, media watchdog warns The Pacific is facing a \u201ccritical moment\u201d for press freedom, the region\u2019s media watchdog has warned, as a number of senior journalists in a range of Pacific countries are facing costly lawsuits and criminal prosecution for alleged defamation. Robert Iroga, the chair of the Pacific Freedom Forum, said: We have seen a few cases coming up \u2026 challenging the fundamentals of press freedom in the region. Iroga said that Pacific countries \u2013 while all distinct and with separate laws governing media \u2013 often face similar cultural and economic challenges that affect press freedom. These include the fact that news outlets are often small with very limited budgets, which means defending lawsuits brought against them can often bankrupt an outlet.

Both the premier and the police minister, Yasmin Catley, have refused to appear and cannot be compelled to appear. Minns said on Tuesday he did not want his staff to give evidence either. Minns argued that if he attended all the inquiries he was requested to appear at he could not do his job. He said he was available during question time and at estimates twice a year. Timothy Roberts, the president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said Minns had played into the hands of those who allegedly concocted the caravan plot and had used it to rush a repressive and fear-based legislative agenda. Roberts said: This is just another example of premier Chris Minns\u2019 disregard for our democracy. It should be of deep concern to all NSW residents that his government is refusing to answer questions from their elected representatives in parliament. Human rights group criticises Minns for not speaking at inquiry in handling of Dural \u2018fake terrorism plot\u2019 The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has criticised the NSW premier, Chris Minns, for his decision not to appear at an upper house inquiry investigating the handling of information about the caravan \u201cfake terrorism plot\u201d at Dural earlier this year. Three of Minns\u2019 staff are being summoned to appear at the inquiry but the premier says he does not want them to give evidence. A previous hearing heard that NSW police briefed the premier and the police minister \u201cvery early on\u201d that the incident was likely a criminal hoax but the premier continued to use language including \u201cmass casualty event\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d in the media. NSW parliament subsequently passed laws including the Places of Worship Act \u2013 which restricts protest \u201cat or near places of worship\u201d but will be challenged in the NSW supreme court later this week. Minns told 2GB radio on Tuesday he did not conceal information but acknowledged a hoax was one possibility put forward by NSW police. Burst water main leads to evacuations at Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre court Judges and magistrates had just taken the bench to hear 550 cases in Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre courtrooms on Tuesday morning when the power suddenly went out throughout the building, AAP reports. After a few moments of confusion, an alert asked everyone to leave the building due to a \u201cstreet emergency\u201d. Crowds of lawyers, judicial staff, accused criminals, and a gaggle of schoolkids on an excursion streamed down fire escape staircases onto Liverpool Street in the city centre. Three people were trapped in the busy elevators inside the court complex. Fire and Rescue NSW confirmed crews had released one person while two others remain stuck in an elevator trapped between two floors. In a statement, Ausgrid said a burst water main had flooded an underground substation in the city, causing the power outage. More than 400 customers in the CBD are still without power just before 1pm. Woman identified after body found in bushland in Sydney\u2019s west A man has been charged with murdering a woman whose body was found in western Sydney by a passerby on the weekend. New South Wales police officers were called to Irwin Street in Werrington on Sunday after the body of 47-year-old Leanne Akrap was located in bushland. She was discovered lying next to clothing and rubbish. A crime scene was established and an investigation commenced with the homicide squad. NSW Police did not comment on the alleged cause of death. A report was to be prepared for the coroner. Bryan Steven Johnson, 47, was arrested at a home on Powell Street in Hobartville on Monday evening and charged with murder, police said. He was refused bail to appear before Penrith local court on Tuesday.

In a statement, NSW Police said about 1.15pm yesterday officers were called to South Parade after two men, with their faces covered, entered a kebab shop and fired eight shots. They left in a black Audi Q7 bearing cloned numberplates. NSW Ambulance paramedics treated three people for gunshot wounds before all were taken to a hospital for further specialist treatment. A 26-year-old man suffered wounds to his shoulder and arm, a 47-year-old woman was shot twice in the torso, and a 25-year-old man was shot in the face. The first two victims are said to be in a stable condition while the second man is said to be in a serious condition. A crime scene was established, and three cars were subsequently found burnt out on Wigram Street in Harris Park, Hilltop Road in Merrylands and Gerald Street in Greystanes. Crime scenes were established at all three locations with officers attached Taskforce Falcon deployed to assist with the investigation. Police are currently examining potential links between the three fires and the shooting at Auburn. The federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, says the Albanese government should have done more to secure a meeting with US President Donald Trump before his early exit from the G7 in Canada today. In a statement, she said Trump\u2019s decision to leave a day before his meeting with Anthony Albanese is understandable but regrettable. \u201cGiven the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, this decision is understandable but to the detriment of Australia. \u201cThis was an important opportunity for the prime minister to seek assurances on Aukus and protect Australia from tariffs. \u201cGiven global volatility and the growing list of issues in our relationship with the United States, this underscores that the Albanese government should not have merely relied on meeting with the president on the sidelines of international summits. \u201cThe prime minister should have been more proactive in seeking to strengthen this relationship \u2013 Australia\u2019s most important \u2013 and we encourage him to change his approach to advance our national interest.\u201d Fate of NSW Liberal party to be decided at crunch meeting after federal takeover The fate of the New South Wales Liberal party will be decided at a crunch meeting today, where the party\u2019s federal executive will weigh up whether to end or extend its control over the division. The federal Liberal party forcibly took over the NSW division in September last year after the NSW branch failed to lodge nominations for 140 candidates in 16 councils before the local government elections. A committee was appointed to replace its state executive for a period of 10 months. On Tuesday, the Liberal party federal executive will decide the next steps for new Liberal leader Sussan Ley\u2019s home state division in one of her first major challenges.

The treasurer said the Iran-Israel situation was a \u201ca perilous moment for the Middle East \u2013 a perilous moment for the global economy as well.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable and not especially surprising that President Trump has headed back to the White House,\u201d he said. Asked by a journalist if it was \u201crude\u201d that Australia may have found out about Trump\u2019s movements via social media posts from the president\u2019s office, Chalmers said \u201cI\u2019m obviously not going to comment on that, I\u2019ve made my view really clear.\u201d \u201cThis is not especially surprising. It\u2019s understandable, given the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. We have a number of opportunities to engage with American counterparts,\u201d he said. Chalmers downplays \u2018understandble\u2019 move from Trump to leave G7 early in face of Middle East crisis It\u2019s \u201cunderstandable\u201d and \u201cnot especially surprising\u201d Donald Trump is leaving the G7 early in the face of a spiralling situation in the Middle East, says the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, downplaying the impact of Anthony Albanese\u2019s meeting being cancelled. Trump, as our Tom McIlroy has been bringing you from Canada, will leave the G7 meeting not long after arriving, and the scheduled meeting with Albanese is now not expected by the Australian side \u2013 one of likely several meetings the US president will skip. Chalmers, in a Sky News interview just now, said Trump\u2019s movements are \u201cnot especially surprising.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that President Trump [will leave] the meeting early. This was always a chance of happening, given what\u2019s happening around the world and particularly in the Middle East,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cPrime Minister Albanese has had three conversations with President Trump in recent months, we\u2019ll continue to engage in the usual way. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially surprising. I do think it\u2019s understandable, given events that are unfolding in a really dangerous part of the world.\u201d Chalmers said Albanese had \u201cother good reasons\u201d to travel to Canada, besides the now-unlikely Trump meeting, noting the PM\u2019s meetings with other world leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important opportunity to speak up for and stand up for Australia\u2019s interests in the world. Obviously, we were looking forward to a meeting between the leaders of Australia and the United States. But again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially surprising, given the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, that President Trump wants to get back to the White House,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cThis was always a prospect of this happening. It\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s not especially surprising, and there\u2019ll be other opportunities to engage.\u201d Victoria announces new \u2018post and boast\u2019 laws to combat youth crime Crooks who post videos of their crimes online will cop extra jail time as part of a crackdown on youth crime, AAP reports. The \u201cpost and boast\u201d laws, announced by the Victorian government on Tuesday, will affect anyone who brags about their crimes on social media and messaging apps. The crimes amendment (performance crime) bill will apply to anyone who publishes content about their involvement in serious and violent crimes such as affray, car thefts, home invasions, burglary and robbery and carjackings, the Victorian attorney general, Sonya Kilkenny, said: It\u2019s about sending the strongest and clearest message to these offenders now that \u2026 crime is not content, it is certainly not entertainment. Third parties such as witnesses, bystanders and journalist won\u2019t be captured by the laws. Anthony Albanese will continue with his program at the G7 summit here in Canada tomorrow, despite Donald Trump leaving early tonight local time. The pair had been due to meet for the first time on the sidelines of the event in Kananaskis in the Rocky Mountains. After the news broke, a government spokesperson said: Given what is occurring in the Middle East this is understandable. As the prime minister said a short time ago, we are very concerned about the events in the Middle East and continue to urge all parties to prioritise dialogue and diplomacy. After a dinner for G7 partner countries hosted by Canada\u2019s governor general tonight, Albanese is due to meet with the leaders of the UK, Germany, the European Union and France at the summit. Death cap mushrooms found in NSW NSW Health said today death cap mushrooms have been found in parts of the state, including Sydney, the Southern Highlands and southern NSW. Officials issued warnings about the health risks of eating wild mushrooms, noting the consumption of death caps can be fatal. Brett Summerell, chief scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, said it can be difficult to identify safe species: There is no easy or reliable way to identify if a wild mushroom is edible or poisonous, so we advise people against foraging for, and eating, wild mushrooms. Cooking poisonous mushrooms does not make them safe to eat. You should only eat mushrooms you buy from a reputable grocery store, supermarket or produce market. There were 23 hospitalisations for the toxic effect of ingested mushrooms in 2024, including two in children under the age of five. If you are worried that mushroom poisoning may have occurred, do not wait for symptoms to appear and call the Poison Information Centre on 13 11 26. Tabcorp has been fined $4m for sending more than 5,700 marketing messages to VIP customers last year in breach of Australia\u2019s spam laws. The penalty is the outcome of the first investigation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority into a VIP gambling program. Between 1 February and 1 May 2024, 2,598 SMS and WhatsApp messages were sent by Tabcorp to customers without an unsubscribe option and 3,148 SMS and WhatsApp messages did not contain adequate sender information. Samantha Yorke, an ACMA member, said the breaches were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d given Tabcorp is an established provider that targets VIP customers. She said: These programs often involve personalised messages offering incentives such as bonus bets, deposit matching, rebates and offers of tickets to sporting and other events. \u201cThe gambling industry needs to understand that spam laws apply to all direct marketing \u2013 whether it\u2019s generic campaigns or personalised messages,\u201d Yorke said, noting VIPs were not necessarily \u201chigh-rollers\u201d and could be under financial strain. \u201cIt is utterly unacceptable that TAB [Tabcorp] did not have adequate spam compliance systems in place.\u201d TAB has entered into a three-year, court-enforceable undertaking, which includes an independent review of its direct marketing systems, quarterly audits of its VIP direct marketing and training staff. Senator David Pocock, an independent, said over the weekend the gambling sector had been \u201cemboldened\u201d by the Albanese government\u2019s failure to act on the recommendations of a 2023 review into the industry by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy. New court bid filed to stop extension of North West Shelf gas project in WA A new court bid has been launched to stop Woodside Energy\u2019s plan to extend the life of the North West Shelf gas export facility in northern Western Australia until 2070. The proposal, which last month won conditional approval from the federal government, has been challenged in the WA supreme court by Friends of Australian Rock Art. In papers lodged with the court last week, the organisation argued the WA government did not properly follow state environment laws when it approved the development last year. Specifically, it alleged the state assessment failed to consider the climate impact of greenhouse gas emissions linked to the project. Judith Hugo, a co-convener of Friends of Australian Rock Art, said: It is clear that the state government is providing enthusiastic support for Woodside\u2019s ongoing gas exports, but that does not detract from the obligation to follow the requirements of our legislation, and that means ensuring the impacts are properly assessed and managed to acceptable levels before any approvals are granted. A Woodside spokesperson said the company was aware of the court action and had \u201cconfidence in the robustness of the state government\u2019s comprehensive approval process\u201d. Tasmania premier calls Smith a \u2018proud and brave Tasmanian\u2019 The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, is speaking about Const Keith Anthony Smith\u2019s long career of service. Rockliff said: Yesterday a proud and brave Tasmanian man, Constable Keith Smith, started his day by putting on his Tasmania Police uniform. A day that began like many others. A day where he started, like all others, to protect and serve us all. Tragically, Constable Smith did not return home to put on the civvies. To be with the people that he loved. Tasmania Police name officer killed in shooting yesterday Tasmanian police have identified Const Keith Anthony Smith, 57, as the victim of a shooting yesterday. Smith, a 25-year-veteran of the police service, was walking up to a home in the state\u2019s north-west yesterday afternoon to serve a warrant when a person inside the house allegedly opened fire, killing him. Tasmania\u2019s police commissioner, Donna Adams, called Smith a dedicated officer and said his death will be mourned by the entire force: Keith was a respected and committed officer, and his loss will be deeply felt across our policing family and the wider community. My heart goes out to Keith\u2019s wife and family. We will be supporting them in every way we can during this incredibly difficult time. The blue family will come together today, and over the next days and weeks, and will support the family and each other. A 46-year-old man remains in hospital under police guard. No charges have been filed so far. A two-bedroom Bondi Junction unit for $1,100 a week. Is \u2018affordable housing\u2019 in Australia really affordable? A two-bedroom apartment in Bondi Junction that is part of an \u201caffordable\u201d housing scheme run by the NSW government has been listed at $1,100 a week to rent, prompting advocates to warn that programs designed to help low-income earners are increasingly out of reach. Across the country, affordable housing programs are meant to offer rent below market rate for low-to-moderate income households that make too much for social housing but not enough for the private market. The two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment in Bondi Junction is listed under the Affordable Housing Scheme by HomeGround Real Estate Sydney, with the guidelines set by the NSW government. Read more: Trump\u2019s departure a blow to PM Donald Trump\u2019s press secretary has confirmed he will leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early, snubbing leaders including Anthony Albanese before planned talks tomorrow. It is a blow for Albanese, who had expected to hold his first face-to-face talks with the president, including covering trade issues and the US review of Aukus. The PM will still meet with leaders including the UK\u2019s Keir Starmer and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron at the Kananaskis summit site. US president Donald Trump is leaving the G7 meeting early, and will depart Canada tonight. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, just wrote on X: President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Much was accomplished, but because of what\u2019s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State. Albanese says he\u2019s always prepared before major meetings The prime minister was asked how he\u2019s prepped himself before his meeting with Trump tomorrow on the sidelines of the G7. Albanese said he\u2019s always prepared: I always prep seriously for meetings where I\u2019m representing Australia. I\u2019ve just been through a test. It\u2019s called a federal election. \u2026 I think that I have a great responsibility. I take that responsibility seriously and I look forward to tomorrow\u2019s meeting, and not just with President Trump. It is important to say that tomorrow as well I\u2019ll be meeting with the prime minister of Japan and I\u2019ll be meeting with the European leaders. PM says evacuations of Australians from Iran pose \u2018challenges\u2019, urges people to stay up-to-date with safety advice Albanese said airspace over Iran remains closed amid the country\u2019s ongoing conflict with Israel, making any evacuations of Australians difficult. He said: That presents challenges. We want to make sure that people are looked after but they need to be looked after safely as well and so the last advice that I had was stay in place provisions were still the advice. I would just encourage Australians either there or Australians who are concerned about family or friends to keep up-to-date with the Australian government\u2019s advice. The prime minister said it would likely take some time to negotiate US tariffs on Australian goods during his meeting with President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 in Canada. Albanese was asked how he would describe expectations from the meeting, saying he doesn\u2019t foresee \u201ccomplete change\u201d from one discussion: That was [what] occurred last time with Australia and tariffs and I don\u2019t think it would be reasonable to expect that you would have a complete change and a complete resolution of the issues, which are there. When I first raised with President Trump the issue of tariffs, of course, he said he would give it great consideration. Albanese added that Trump would \u201calways be a welcome guest in Australia\u201d when asked about any diplomatic visit. Nato secretary-general praises Australia\u2019s leadership on Ukraine The secretary-general of Nato has praised Australia\u2019s role responding to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, telling Anthony Albanese that Europe, the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are \u201cinterconnected\u201d because of the conflict. Albanese met Mark Rutte, the former prime minister of the Netherlands, in Calgary as G7 leaders gather for tomorrow\u2019s summit in the Rocky Mountains resort town Kananaskis. Rutte warned China was acting with Russia, North Korea and Iran to prolong the bloody war. He said: It is Russia with North Korea, with China, even Iran supporting the war effort, so this is all getting more and more interconnected. I want to thank you for your leadership on Ukraine. It\u2019s really important that [Australia is] so far away and still so close and willing to really be helpful here. Rutte said Nato and Australia could do more on defence industrial production and congratulated Albanese on his 3 May election win. Albanese called Russia\u2019s actions immoral and illegal and restated a promise from Australia to commit troops to a peace keeping force, if a ceasefire can be achieved. The prime minister said: I think the democratic world needs to defend our values, and we\u2019re seeing that play out. Triple J announces birthday edition for Hottest 100 Australian Songs vote Triple J just announced a special, mid-year Hottest 100 of Australian Songs to celebrate the station\u2019s 50th birthday. Voting starts today and runs for the next month. Triple J said: It\u2019s a big year for the triple j family, so what better way to toast our deep history than by doing our favourite thing: wringing our hands over trying to pick only 10 of our favourite songs released by Australian artists and bands. Nah, it\u2019ll be a breeze, right? \u2026 They\u2019ve been the playlist to our lives, defined the sound of the nation and echoed across generations, and now we get to champion all the tracks that have lasted a lifetime (or more). South Korean president tells Albanese he looks \u2018much younger and good looking\u2019 than he imagined from phone call Prime minister Anthony Albanese met with South Korea\u2019s newly elected president, Lee Jae-myung, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Alberta, Canada. The pair had spoken on the phone in the past few days, after the presidential election and the resolution of South Korea\u2019s constitutional crisis. In a tiny hotel room in downtown Calgary in the past few minutes, Albanese showed the pair had clear rapport already. He received an unlikely compliment from the South Korean leader, who told him: We had a phone call just a few days ago, and you look much younger and good looking than I imagined from your voice. \u201cYou are very kind,\u201d Albanese responded. \u201cI think winning an election takes a few years off your appearance.\u201d The pair talked about Australia\u2019s service during the Korean war, as well as the upcoming Asia-Pacific economic cooperation summit in South Korea in October. The South Korean president said he looked forward to visiting Australia again, saying he had been impressed by the country\u2019s natural beauty the first time he travelled in the country. Albanese will meet Nato\u2019s secretary general, Mark Rutte, next up today. Chris Minns calls gangland attacks \u2018vicious, disgusting behaviour\u2019 after lunchtime shooting The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said the shooting at a restaurant in the Sydney suburb of Auburn yesterday was \u201cvicious, disgusting behaviour from complete animals\u201d. Minns spoke to 2GB after the brazen attack, where three people were wounded at a kebab shop after a gunman allegedly opened fire inside. He said: The disregard for human life for people who are innocent bystanders is appalling. Obviously I think it just churns your stomach to believe there are people out there who would pursue this kind of crime and have such disregard for members of the public. Minns reiterated his pledge that NSW police would see those charged with such crimes \u201cspend a long time, decades, in tiny prison cells\u201d. Read more here: Shadow finance minister calls on PM to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP so \u2018it\u2019s not a partisan issue\u2019 James Paterson, the shadow finance minister, said the Coalition again called on the Albanese government to raise defence spending to 3% as a proportion of GDP, saying those calls are a task \u201cwe will happily take on over this term of parliament\u201d. Paterson told RN Breakfast: We are almost three years away from the next election, but before the next election, we\u2019ll outline any savings that are necessary to make sure that is possible. \u2026 Frankly, it\u2019s my hope that the Albanese government does that in this term of parliament so it is not a partisan issue by the next election. RN host Sally Sara pressed Paterson on how the Coalition would pay for that proposal, which would amount to billions more in spending per year. Paterson said he couldn\u2019t \u201coutline exactly the dollars and cents\u201d: There will be three budgets and three mid-year economic and fiscal outlooks between now and the next election. And this government will make decisions on defence spending and many other things that will have implications for whatever provision we need to make for these things. So it\u2019s not possible to give you the exact numbers today, but I can give you a commitment that will be upfront and transparent and honest about it. Pat Conroy says government will always put Australian safety first in global conflicts Conroy was asked if there is a greater threat Australia could be drawn into a hypothetical conflict between the US and China after defence minister Richard Marles said yesterday Australia\u2019s military contingent was \u201cmore relevant to [the] great power contest now than its ever been before\u201d. Conroy told RN Breakfast: I\u2019m always careful about engaging in hypotheticals and our sovereignty remains paramount. The elected Australian government of the day will always decide whether we\u2019ll be involved in a conflict or we will allow our continent to be used for operations, and that\u2019s a really important principle. But we live in a period of huge strategic uncertainty. That\u2019s why we\u2019re significantly increasing the defence budget. And we will continue to make decisions in the national interest to put the safety of Australians first. Pat Conroy, the minister for the defence industry, said the government is still preparing to evacuate a number of Australians from Iran following Israel\u2019s ongoing strikes on the country. Conroy, speaking to RN Breakfast, said he expected a \u201cfair number\u201d of people would seek to board repatriation flights, but noted there were likely a lot of dual citizens who would stay in Iran. He said: The air zones are closed at the moment, so planes can\u2019t get in and out, but we\u2019re preparing plans to evacuate Australians or assist in them getting on to commercial flights when those zones do open again. It\u2019s going to be challenging. There\u2019ll be a lot of people probably wanting to exit. So we have to be careful, but we\u2019re in contact with as many people as possible. Conroy urged Australians in conflict zones to register with Dfat. A man was charged with murder last night after a woman\u2019s body was found in Sydney\u2019s west. Officers responded to the suburb of Werrington on Sunday around 1.15pm after a passer-by reported a body found in bushland in the area. NSW Police established a crime scene and undertook extensive enquires into the 47-year-old woman\u2019s death. A man, also 47, was arrested on Monday evening in Hobartville and charged on allegations of murder. He was refused bail and will appear later today before Penrith local court. South Australia says support for Santos takeover bid will be contingent on \u2018the state\u2019s best interest\u2019 Santos, Australia\u2019s second-largest gas producer, has early backing from its board for a $30bn takeover bid by a consortium led by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Shares in the oil and gas giant have soared on the news, but the deal may depend on winning over a state government, AAP reports. Any transfer of licence holders under the South Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act must be signed off by the state\u2019s energy minister. SA\u2019s premier, Peter Malinauskas, says the \u201cstate government\u2019s priority at all times is to ensure that South Australian jobs remain in South Australia, and to maintain Santos\u2019 headquarters in Adelaide\u201d, adding: Any judgments we make regarding this process will be made in the state\u2019s best interests. Abu Dhabi National Oil has expressed interest in acquiring Santos since July 2024, after negotiations of a potential merger between Santos and local competitor Woodside wound up in February 2024. Victorian Greens push bill to enshrine housing as a human right The Victorian Greens will introduce a bill to state parliament today to enshrine housing as a human right and have written to the premier, Jacinta Allan, calling on her support. Under the bill, the right to housing would be added to the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. This would mean government departments, the police and the courts would all need to comply with and uphold the right to adequate housing. Any future laws and regulations would also have to comply with the charter. The bill also specifies that housing should be structurally sound and located to appropriate public services and employment. The Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Richmond MP Gabrielle de Vietri, said the bill would \u201cfundamentally change the way we think about housing\u201d. She said: Today we are offering something all MPs across the political spectrum can agree on \u2013 that everyone has a right to a safe and affordable home. Anyone who votes down this bill will need a bloody good explanation for the more than one million Victorians in housing stress. De Vietri also wrote to Allan urging Labor to support the bill, which will be introduced on Tuesday then second read on Wednesday. However, that is unlikely as the party generally doesn\u2019t support non-government bills. It follows a similar push made in federal parliament last year by independents David Pocock and Kylea Tink. It was supported by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Good morning, Nick Visser here to take you through the day\u2019s news. Thanks to Martin Farrer for getting things started. Renewables push in Queensland for cooperation between state and federal governments The Queensland state government is being urged to do a deal with the commonwealth for national support to build more local renewable energy and storage projects. The federal government has made renewable energy transformation agreements with every other state, meaning billions of dollars of Commonwealth funding become available for green power projects like batteries and solar. Stephanie Gray, a campaigner with the Queensland Conservation Council, said regional communities deserve their fair share of federal funding. We\u2019re concerned recent moves by the Queensland government indicate they\u2019re opposed to new clean energy investment, which if true, is bad news for regional economies, power bills and climate action. The Queensland government has recently cancelled a windfarm they previously approved and moved to implement controversial legislation changes that will make it very challenging to get a large-scale renewable project approved. Gray said Queensland\u2019s coal-fired power stations had broken down \u201ca staggering 78 times over the last summer period\u201d. As our ageing coal fleet heads towards retirement, it\u2019s only practical to make sure that new renewable energy supply is coming online to keep the lights on, manage power bills and reduce emissions in our most polluting sector \u2026 We simply cannot depend on our coal clunkers any more, and their unreliability is driving up wholesale power prices. Investigation launched after NSW plane crash An investigation has been launched after a pilot died when his recreational aircraft crashed in NSW\u2019s central west yesterday afternoon. Officers were called to Meadowview Road near Tottenham, about 140km north-west of Parkes, at around 3.40pm when the aircraft was found crashed in a paddock. The 48-year-old pilot, a local man, died in the crash. A report will be prepared for the coroner while an investigation into the crash is being conducted by Recreational Aircraft Australia. More than half of Australians support or strongly support reducing tax concessions for super balances over $3m, according to YouGov polling commissioned by the Australia Institute. The polling found 52% backed the idea, while 26% of people oppose or strongly oppose the changes and 22% are undecided. YouGov surveyed 1,535 voters finding those between 25 and 34 years and 35 and 49 years supported the proposed tax change the most. Those over 50 supported it the least. The most supportive also happened to be those who voted independent, followed by Labor and Greens voters. The Australia Institute\u2019s executive director, Richard Denniss, said it should come \u201cas no surprise\u201d that many Australians don\u2019t \u201cshare the hysteria\u201d about the proposed policy change. \u201cGiven that most Australians have less than $200,000 in super, it should come as no surprise that the vast majority of ordinary Australians don\u2019t share the hysteria about this small change expressed by some very vocal critics ...\u201d \u201cOne of the most interesting results is that independent voters, the voters who have cost the Liberal party so many of their once safest seats, are the most supportive of Labor\u2019s proposed changes.\u201d Trump says G7 \u2018wrong\u2019 to kick out Russia and advocates for Chinese membership As Albanese lines up meetings, the main G7 action is in full swing. Donald Trump has met the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, and other world leaders here in Canada overnight. Trump said the G7 was wrong to kick out Russia, and that he would like the group of economic powers to be restored to the G8. Trump and Carney talked about tariffs and international trade, similar themes to what is expected when the US president sits down with Anthony Albanese on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m a tariff person. I\u2019ve always been a tariff person,\u201d Trump said in his press conference. \u201cI think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good. We\u2019re going to take a look at both.\u201d Trump also advocated for China to join the grouping. Albanese is having private meetings this morning, Canadian time, ahead of his formal talks with the leaders of Nato and South Korea. What\u2019s on Albanese\u2019s agenda at the G7 summit? Anthony Albanese is in Calgary again today, meeting world leaders ahead of tomorrow\u2019s G7 summit in nearly Ananaskis. On the agenda for the PM today are bilateral talks with South Korea\u2019s new president, Lee Jae-myung, and Nato\u2019s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Both talks are expected to focus on defence and security, including the possibility of South Korea building new frigates for the Australian Defence Force. In talks with Rutte, Albanese is expected to discuss Australia\u2019s ongoing commitment to supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Later in the day, Albanese is due to attend a welcome reception for G7 outreach leaders hosted by Alberta\u2019s premier, Danielle Smith, ahead of a welcome dinner hosted by the governor general of Canada, Mary Simon. All eyes are on Albanese\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump on Tuesday local time (Wednesday here), the first time the two leaders will meet face to face. As mentioned earlier, our chief political correspondent, Tom McIlroy, is in Canada and he has sent an analysis of how the prime minister might be trying to approach this week\u2019s summit. Tom argues that Anthony Albanese will be treading a delicate path in Alberta as he tries to pivot gently towards building more alliances while trying to avoid controversy with Donald Trump. Read his piece here: Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Nick Visser to guide you through what may well be another very busy news day. Our chief political correspondent, Tom McIlroy, is in Canada at the G7 summit in Canada, where Anthony Albanese is lining up meetings with leaders and trying to navigate the currents of geopolitical crisis. We\u2019ll have blow-by-blow coverage and analysis for you here soon. On the domestic political front it\u2019s a big day with the fate of the New South Wales Liberal party to be decided. The party\u2019s federal executive will weigh up whether to end or extend its control over the division at a crunch meeting.

A report published on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated that China now has at least 600 nuclear warheads, with about 100 per year being added to the stockpile since 2023. At a regular foreign ministry press briefing on Monday, spokesperson Guo Jiakun declined to comment on the report but said: \u201cChina has always adhered to the nuclear strategy of self-defence, always maintained its nuclear forces at the minimum level required for national security, and has not participated in the arms race.\u201d Guo said that China adheres to a policy of not being the first to use nuclear weapons at any time, and that China would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear armed states. \u201cChina will continue to firmly commit to safeguarding its legitimate security interests and maintaining world peace and stability,\u201d Guo said. At the current rate of increases, China could have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. That is nearly as many as Russia and the US currently have ready for use at short notice. Russia and the US\u2019s total inventories of weapons, which include both ready-to-use weapons and mothballed warheads, are far bigger. According to SIPRI\u2019s research, Russia has 5,459 warheads while the US has 5,177. The two countries hold about 90% of the global stockpile. Last year, the US approved a new nuclear strategy that is focused on the threat from China. China is thought to have 24 nuclear warheads that are already placed on missiles or located in bases with operational forces, meaning that they could be deployed at very short notice. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has expanded the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal faster than any other Chinese leader. Previous leaders, such as Deng Xiaoping, argued that China only needed modest reserves to act as a deterrent for potential adversaries. China\u2019s nuclear capabilities are of particular concern to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its own territory. Beijing has resolved to \u201cunify\u201d Taiwan with the People\u2019s Republic of China, using force if necessary. Chinese scholars have argued that having a powerful deterrent, such as nuclear weapons, could prevent any third party from intervening in a conflict. The threat of a US intervention in support of Taiwan is one of the factors that is keeping a war at bay. The report\u2019s authors noted fewer warheads are being dismantled each year, while the pace of deployment of new nuclear weapons is accelerating. Hans M. Kristensen, an associate senior fellow at SIPRI, said: \u201cThe era of reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in the world, which had lasted since the end of the cold war, is coming to an end\u201d. Hundreds of facilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), long-range missiles used to deliver nuclear weapons, are being built in desert fields in the north of China. Three mountainous areas in the east of China also house ICBM silos, according to the report.

It was opening night of the adaptation of her 2008 novel, The Spare Room, based on her experience caring for a dying friend who came to stay with her. \u201cThey were the three worst weeks of my life, they were just unforgettably dreadful,\u201d Garner said in conversation with Jennifer Byrne at Belvoir on Monday evening. \u201cI came along [to opening night] feeling that I would find it unbearable to live those three weeks again.\u201d After the show, she crawled into bed \u201cexhausted\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep very well now, since I got old, but I got into bed and I slept without moving for nine hours,\u201d Garner said. \u201cSeeing those three weeks played out on stage resolved something in me.\u201d In The Spare Room, the narrator, Helen, gamely agrees to host her old friend Nicola when she flies from Sydney to Melbourne to attend a cancer clinic, without realising how close to death she is. As the novel opens, Helen is preparing her spare room for her friend \u2013 fresh sheets, plumped pillows, a new rug, flowers \u2013 confident in her capabilities as a hostess and carer. This is quickly punctured by Nicola\u2019s shocking frailty and poor health, and her irrational optimism about her prognosis and the clinic\u2019s dubious treatment protocol \u2013 which turns out to be Vitamin C injections and \u201cozone baths\u201d. There follows a power struggle: Helen\u2019s fierce love for her friend gives way to excoriating rage at her delusional positivity and refusal to admit she\u2019s dying, while Nicola stubbornly resists Helen\u2019s attempts to arrange proper pain medication and palliative care. \u201cI was cruel to her,\u201d Garner confessed, reflecting on her experience with her friend (Jenya Osborne, who died in 2006), adding: \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s in a trance of craziness, you want to snap them out of it \u2013 and that can make you cruel, harsh.\u201d Belvoir\u2019s artistic director, Eamon Flack, who adapted the novel for stage, said it was Garner\u2019s frank depiction of an older woman\u2019s rage that drew him to it. Garner said she was criticised for precisely this aspect of her novel when it was first published. \u201cQuite a few older men criticised it because they said it was too full of anger \u2026 I was kind of shocked, actually, [because] we rage against death; there\u2019s a lot of anger in us when death is in the room.\u201d These criticisms upset her, she admitted. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to [be seen as] \u2018Oh, you\u2019re so angry.\u2019 \u2018Why are you so angry, Helen? You\u2019re always angry\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s something people [have said]. Even my grandson said this to me the other day: \u2018Hel, you\u2019re full of anger,\u2019\u201d she said, rearing back in mock rage: \u201cI said, \u2018How dare you!\u2019\u201d Not a single woman has criticised The Spare Room for its anger, Garner said; instead, many older women thanked her for depicting the carer\u2019s experience. One full-time carer told her: \u201cHelen, we all feel that anger. We\u2019re all tormented by it. Don\u2019t be ashamed of it. It\u2019s part of the whole thing. You have to go there.\u201d In Belvoir\u2019s adaptation, Helen is portrayed by stage and screen veteran Judy Davis \u2013 a performance that Garner said she found \u201cshattering\u201d to watch. \u201cBut it took me a moment to get used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t go to the theatre much any more.

A process hijacked by opportunists will only fail victims again, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "content": "Poison runs through every aspect of the grooming gang horror. Every element stirs up a particular political bile, from those pathetically vulnerable girls and their vile exploiters, to those well-chosen cases weaponised by the Tories and Faragists with no record of concern for the general plight of children in care. It\u2019s odd that the Tories should wade in so strenuously when they were in power for the vast majority of this sorry saga, provoking a stream of inquiries, which they mostly ignored. Labour thought the seven years and \u00a3187m of Alexis Jay\u2019s second inquiry quite enough. So did she, echoing Keir Starmer\u2019s preference for \u201caction not words\u201d, and for avoiding yet more of the analysis paralysis of the Grenfell years, the infected blood scandal and ongoing Covid inquiries, which satisfy few. A series of five local investigations was planned, starting in Oldham. Starmer sent Louise Casey to do an audit, and she has returned suggesting a novel format, with a national umbrella body to oversee local inquiries with statutory teeth to compel witnesses to come forward. \u201cGotcha! U-turn!\u201d shout Reform, the Tories and their favourable front pages, fighting in the political playground regardless of the substance. U-turns, second thoughts, listening to critics and responding to new facts are usually a good thing in governments: we could do with a few more. As for U-turns, let\u2019s not forget Boris Johnson, who called spending money on investigating child sex abuse \u201cspaffing money up the wall\u201d. The Tories later made him prime minister. Casey was given a free hand to \u201cuncover the nature, scale and profile\u201d of group child sexual exploitation, to root out evidence on offenders and their ethnicity. No surprise that she found plentiful cases where authorities had turned away, some for fear of being called racist. Last week\u2019s trial of seven Rochdale men of Pakistani origin told the same story: of groomers raping and drugging very young girls, and showing \u201cno remorse for their unforgivable actions\u201d, while officialdom also treated these children as trash. Social workers dismissed witness girl B as \u201ca prostitute\u201d, aged 10. Blame spreads far and wide. Those seeking a culture war weapon will find it turned back on them. A timeline in Casey\u2019s report following some 10 inquiries makes grim reading on foot-dragging police and authorities who scorned girls\u2019 stories: why was so little followed up? Labour has picked report recommendations to act upon: home secretary Yvette Cooper\u2019s order to check prematurely closed cases has already re-opened more than 800. She is asking the National Crime Agency to trace missing perpetrators and toughen local police investigations. She is wiping out child victims\u2019 criminal records for prostitution, while her \u201cHillsborough law\u201d gives public bodies a duty of candour, with the threat of criminal sanctions if they obstruct investigations. So-called consent by under-16s will not absolve men from rape. Children will get files linking fragmented information from the healthcare system, schools and social workers. The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, tells Sky that \u201chundreds of people in positions of authority over the years deliberately covered this up. I think they are guilty of that criminal offence and frankly should be going to prison.\u201d But who was the minister for crime and policing in the last government? He was. Kemi Badenoch was minister for children. Starmer stands by his accusation that politicians with new zeal for an inquiry are \u201cjumping on a far-right bandwagon\u201d: that it\u2019s only the race element that stirs them. Cases cross Tory and Labour councils, there have been failings all round. Every minute of Starmer\u2019s time as director of public prosecutions has been turned over, but it only shows his record as the rapid accelerator of prosecutions. The bizarre intervention of Elon Musk ignited this pile-on, with his accusation that Starmer was \u201cdeeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes\u201d, and calling Jess Phillips a \u201crape genocide apologist\u201d. Musk was fired up by Labour voting down a Badenoch amendment to the children\u2019s wellbeing and schools bill, calling for another inquiry: a move specifically designed to make Labour\u2019s refusal look shifty. Playing the opportunistic Westminster game, hers was a wrecking amendment to kill the whole bill \u2013 never mind that it would have knocked out a string of protections for children in care. Facts matter, but we need more of them. Casey finds that British-Pakistani men are much over-represented in some of the regional statistics that do exist for these crimes \u2013 but she also says: \u201cThe ethnicity data collected for victims and perpetrators of group-based child sexual exploitation is not sufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn at the national level.\u201d Both Casey and Cooper regard the figures as badly incomplete; ethnicity data was only recorded in a third of cases in the Hydrant programme, which collates police data on perpetrators and victims. That\u2019s inadequate, but here\u2019s the latest from the data that has been recorded: 83% of suspects are white, 7% Asian, 5% black. When on a radio phone-in I hear someone say this crime is \u201cpredominantly\u201d Pakistani, they are only repeating the kind of misinformation written by Rod Liddle in the Sunday Times this week: he calls grooming abuse \u201calmost exclusively Muslim (and usually Pakistani) men preying almost exclusively on young white girls\u201d. Indeed, men of Pakistani origin in available statistics about the perpetrators, but Richard Fewkes, the director of Hydrant, says offenders broadly reflect the ethnic mix of the UK population: \u201cIn very general terms, what we see across all group-based offending is that no particular ethnicity stands out based on population data.\u201d He may amend that in time, but those on the frontline worry that false facts draw attention away from where most child group sex abuse happens: 57% in institutions, 26% by group sex abusers within families, and 48% by other children Be clear what is happening here. Abuse of the most vulnerable people is a matter for us all, but race is what excites the culture warriors. They show little interest in the plight of children in care. In the Tory years, the number of children in care rose from 64,400 in 2010 to 83,630 in the latest figures. Cuts to social workers, health visitors and district nurses, the loss of Sure Start and the axing of child benefits have pushed families over the edge and children into the unkind arms of the state. Can it have been anything but irony when Tories branded their children in care programme \u201cStable Homes, Built on Love\u201d? The outcomes for these children are dismal and their futures bleak, after multiple placements and rapid ejection at the age of 16, alone into isolated flats. Take just one official figure: 44% of those registered as \u201cchildren in need\u201d are persistently absent from school. Where are they? In the clutches of bad men offering drugs and fake affection? The spending review\u2019s extra money for children in care and the children\u2019s bill\u2019s boost for kinship and foster carers will help, with strengthened support for care leavers, and a challenge to the astronomical profits made by private companies offering bad care. But will it be enough to lift the blight that has forever branded these children as no-hopers? Too early to say. But in the meantime, beware those politicians who are newly exercised by the plight of abused children \u2013 but only if the abusers are, say, Pakistani. Beware also the synthetic pity of so many who have until now ignored the state\u2019s appalling treatment of the most vulnerable children in its care. Too many are opportunists seeking grotesque advantage.

This will probably get me in trouble with my mother in a way that coming out as bisexual never did, because she believed that you should always be your authentic self, so long as you have good taste. Stomp clap music has often been the subject of much derision and a bit of a punchline. But despite the ridicule, I\u2019m willing to defend my taste. The genre, sometimes referred to as stomp and holler or indie folk, peaked in the 2000s, with bands such as the Lumineers, Of Monsters and Men and, of course, Mumford &amp; Sons \u2013 think a lot of guitars, banjos, the odd fiddle, literal stomping and clapping, with the occasional rousing \u201chey!\u201d in the background. It was largely associated with hipsters \u2013 the twirly moustached, braces and Henley-shirt-wearing kind \u2013 and with band members who all look like Sunday school preachers and youth pastors. I can\u2019t stand the aesthetic, but the music is undeniable. So how did a black queer woman \u2013 raised on jazz and soul \u2013 end up loving these bands? Mostly through a lot of late nights on Tumblr \u2013 the mainstay of any teenager figuring themselves out in the 2010s. I was obsessed with the Norwegian teen drama Skam and all its various iterations and adaptations. It\u2019s an obsession that led me to Tumblr, where there were tonnes of fan edits (short video tributes to the show\u2019s couples and characters), all set to an endless stream of stomp and clap such as the Lumineers\u2019 Ophelia or King and Lionheart by Of Monsters And Men. Though my music taste wasn\u2019t limited, it definitely wasn\u2019t cool (whatever that means). As my love for the genre grew, my friends, a small group of queer kids at a Catholic school, were very much live and let live with my choices \u2013 we were already on the outskirts anyway. It was never exactly something to bust out at a group sesh, though. I think the closest I could get was Ed Sheeran\u2019s Nancy Mulligan, which we could all agree was good \u201cstraight white\u201d music. Now 23, I am (nearly) past that phase, but at the time the music was always a comfort to me, as I wrestled with coming out. Against the joyful twang of the banjo, the music was melancholy, but never devastating \u2013 a contrast to the turmoil I felt inside. There was longing and regret and unrequited love, but also hope after heartbreak. Songs such as Cleopatra by the Lumineers spoke to the lifelong regret of not telling someone you love them out of fear. Others, such as The Night We Met by Lord Huron, portrayed the first intense heartache you feel after drifting out of a relationship, something that spoke to me as I drifted home, aged 16, after kissing a girl for the first time \u2013 not able yet to talk about it, music was my solace. My love for these bands (with the exception of Mumford &amp; Sons, you know what you did) was as much about the self-discovery as it was the music. Growing up, I loved emo indie bands because my friends put me on to them, while jazz and soul were a part of my upbringing. My violin lessons are why you will find Beethoven next to Cowboy Carter on my playlists. But indie folk was all mine, music discovered in an online community almost as an antidote to the catholic guilt and self-loathing I was battling through.

The Guardian has previously revealed how gambling operators are exploiting favourable planning and licensing laws to flood UK high streets with \u201cadult gaming centres\u201d (AGCs), which are disproportionately concentrated in the poorest areas. The shops must offer self-exclusion schemes to customers who fear they have a problem with slot machines, which are consistently linked with higher rates of addiction than products such as sports betting. But a documentary by BBC File on 4 Investigates, due to be broadcast on Tuesday evening, found that in one UK city 13 out of 14 venues failed to implement the scheme properly. An undercover reporter for the programme signed up to exclude himself from all AGCs within a 40km radius of Game Nation, a slot machine venue in Portsmouth. He was prevented from entering the Game Nation branch soon after, indicating that the company\u2019s self-exclusion scheme worked.

The study shows that such extreme events are becoming more frequent, longer-lasting and more severe, with last year\u2019s figures reaching twice that of the 2003-2020 average. The steepness of the rise was not foreseen. The researchers say they are amazed and alarmed by the latest figures from the watchful eye of Nasa\u2019s Grace satellite, which tracks environmental changes in the planet. They say climate change is the most likely cause of the apparent trend, even though the intensity of extremes appears to have soared even faster than global temperatures. A Met Office expert said increases in extremes have long been predicted but are now being seen in reality. He warned that people were unprepared for such weather events, which would be outside previous experience. The data is not yet peer-reviewed, and researchers said they would need another 10 or more years to confirm to conclusively call it a trend. The data has been co-produced by Dr Bailing Li, from the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center \u2013 affiliated with the University of Maryland\u2019s Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, who told the Guardian: \u201cWe can\u2019t prove causation yet \u2013 we would need a much longer dataset. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly what\u2019s happening here, but other events suggest that (global) warming is the driving factor. We are seeing more and more extreme events round the world, so this is certainly alarming.\u201d Her colleague Dr Matthew Rodell, chief of hydrologic sciences at Goddard, also counselled caution over the latest data, but admitted that he too was worried about the apparent acceleration of a trend in destructive events. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly scary,\u201d he said. The earlier part of the Nasa time series was published in Nature Water in 2023. The researchers used a mathematical formula to calculate the total effect of a weather event in terms of severity measured by the total area affected, the duration of the event and how wet or dry it was. The paper warned that disturbance to the water system would be one of the most significant consequences of the climate crisis. The paper noted that the intensity of extremes was strongly correlated with global mean temperature, more so than with El Ni\u00f1o, the influential ocean current, or other climate indicators, suggesting that continued warming of the planet will cause more frequent, more severe, and longer and/or larger droughts and floods. The Nasa researchers produced the updated statistics at the request of the Oxford-based research organisation Global Water Intelligence, whose head, Christopher Gasson, said water companies were in the firing line of climate change \u2013 facing too much water or too little water \u2013 or both. He said most water companies were completely unprepared to cope with the changes under way. \u201cThis is extremely scary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry needs to attract investment on a massive scale.\u201d Prof Richard Betts, head of climate change impacts at the Met Office and Exeter University, said of the Nasa report: \u201cThis is a stark reminder that a hotter planet means more severe floods and droughts. This has long been predicted, but is now being seen in reality. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t prepared for the changes in intense rainfall and drought that are now occurring. All around the world people have built their ways of living around the weather that they and their forebears were used to, which leaves them vulnerable to more frequent and severe extremes that are outside past experience. As well as urgently ramping up efforts to reduce emissions to halt global warming, we need to catch up on adaptation to live better with the changes that are already happening.\u201d A recent report by the charity WaterAid said extreme fluctuations between floods and droughts were devastating millions of lives, with many major cities experiencing \u201cwhiplash\u201d events from drought to flood or heat to cold \u2013 or vice versa. The Royal Meteorological Society warned that such sudden transitions from one extreme to the other caused more harm than the individual events alone, affecting agriculture, infrastructure, biodiversity and human health. Their report said: \u201cRising temperatures are disrupting key drivers such as the jet stream and the polar vortex, changing our weather patterns.\u201d Asher Minns, from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, said that their own unpublished UK-based studies also showed more intensification of both droughts and floods as well as abrupt shifts between extreme wet and dry conditions \u2013 called hydroclimatic whiplash events. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s latest report calculates an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will top 2024 as the warmest year on record. It says global temperatures are set to continue to increase over the next five years, increasing climate risks and impacts on societies, economies, and sustainable development.

The broadcasters are aiming to attract some of the approximately \u00a330bn spent on digital advertising in the UK. The broadcast video-on-demand market (BVOD), which includes the streaming services run by traditional UK broadcasters, is worth about \u00a31.1bn annually, according to AA/Warc figures.

Amanita phalloides, commonly known as death cap mushrooms, have been found growing in Sydney, the southern highlands, southern NSW and the Adelaide hills after high rainfall, health officials say. They warn that children are particularly at risk. NSW Health did not disclose exact areas where the death caps had been found, so people would not seek them out. The chief scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Prof Brett Summerell, said some poisonous varieties could look \u201cjust like a mushroom you\u2019d buy from the supermarket\u201d, making them extremely dangerous to forage. \u201cThey\u2019re usually associated with the roots of oak trees and exotics, as well as cooler areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Sydney we\u2019ve found them in areas with established trees.\u201d It is estimated that half a death cap mushroom can kill an adult, and that the species has caused 90% of the world\u2019s mushroom-related fatalities. Last year 23 people were hospitalised for the toxic effect of ingested mushrooms in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory, including two children under five. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Amid coverage of the high-profile Victorian mushroom trial, Summerell said there had been a rise in people uploading sightings on websites including iNaturalist, where users identify plants and other living organisms. \u201cPeople are taking more notice of mushrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe notoriety helps to get people interested.\u201d Originating in Europe, death caps were first confirmed to be growing in Australia in the 1960s, initially in Canberra and then Melbourne in the 1970s. The species has spread to Asia, southern Africa and the Americas, probably on the roots of imported trees. Wild mushrooms typically grow from late summer to early winter in wet and damp weather. Summerell said as oak trees were generally propagated in Victoria, they could have been transported to NSW that way, or grown undetected. \u201cAfter the 2019/2020 fires, there\u2019s been year after year of intense rain, so there may have been a combination of good mushroom seasons and propagation,\u201d he said. The NSW Poisons Information Centre (PIC) said it had responded to 363 calls for exposure to wild mushrooms across NSW and the ACT in 2024, up 26% from 2023. In the year to 31 May 2025, there had been 190 calls related to wild mushroom exposure. Most cases involved symptoms of poisoning, the medical director of NSW PIC, Dr Darren Roberts said. More than half (196) of calls in 2024 related to children under five who had ingested mushrooms while playing outside in NSW and the ACT. The SA PIC took 100 mushroom-related calls last year, with 23 hospitalisations. Almost half of calls related to children under five. Roberts said the volume of calls about young children was a \u201cconcern\u201d. \u201cWild mushrooms can pop up overnight, so it is really important parents check any outdoor spaces where their child plays and remove wild mushrooms as they appear.\u201d Genevieve Adamo, a senior specialist at the NSW centre, said symptoms of mushroom poisoning included stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. At least 10 deaths in Australia have been attributed to death caps, including a 98-year-old Melbourne woman who picked them from her garden in 2024 and three lunch guests in Leongatha, Victoria, in 2023. Adamo said the onset of symptoms could occur up to 24 hours after ingestion, depending on the type and amount eaten. Early treatment was \u201cvital\u201d to survival, she said. \u201cAs young children have a tendency to put things in their mouths, they can be at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cWatch your children \u2026 especially around large trees in parks or your garden at home where mushrooms may grow.\u201d If you worried that mushroom poisoning may have occurred, do not wait for symptoms to appear.

The Netherlands has long prided itself on its unique system of kraamzorg (maternity care), whereby a maternity care assistant comes to a new family\u2019s home for eight days after a baby\u2019s birth, caring for mother and infant. But on Tuesday, five healthcare unions are expected to present a manifesto and petition of almost 15,000 signatures to MPs in The Hague, warning that a shortage of labour and competition from other care jobs have left the system facing crisis. The petition calls for a guarantee of the future of good kraamzorg for all mothers and newborns in the Netherlands. The unions want a dedicated ministerial representative and better pay, including for \u201cwaiting\u201d time, where care workers have to be available in case babies are born but receive about \u20ac11.50 (\u00a39.80) for an eight-hour shift, before tax.

In a hospital or maternity unit birth, women are typically discharged within hours and the care worker then visits every day to monitor mother and baby. The system, mostly paid for through health insurance, offers between 24 and 80 hours of care. But in periods such as the summer holiday it is creaking at the seams, said GreenLeft MP and former midwife Elke Slagt-Tichelman. \u201cIf there\u2019s a peak with births in a region, it can be exhausting for the maternity care assistants to get the schedule organised, and sometimes parents get less assistance,\u201d she said. Although vital, she added, the job of maternity care assistant was challenging and \u201cnot attractive\u201d from a remunerative point of view. \u201cLike taking care of the elderly, it is a really underpaid job,\u201d she said. But Verveen \u2013 who said that in three years she had saved a 24-hour-old girl from choking and helped 200 families \u2013 said the profession had a value far beyond income. \u201cThere is something magical about life as a maternity carer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou help a family start up a new life.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/the-netherlands-world-leading-postnatal-care-facing-crisis-unions-warn", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "The Netherlands has long prided itself on its unique system of kraamzorg (maternity care), whereby a maternity care assistant comes to a new family\u2019s home for eight days after a baby\u2019s birth, caring for mother and infant. \u201cLast year there were 500 families without a maternity care assistant,\u201d said Dani\u00eblle Verveen, a care assistant from Krommenie, near Amsterdam. \u201cThe Netherlands is the only country that has this care,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "A Berlin audience has fake faeces thrown at them \u2013 and is moved to tears.

The subsequent headlines in the international press were a badge of honour to Holzinger; she wears them printed in black letters on her white T-shirt when talking to the press: \u201cWent to the opera, vomited.\u201d Protests by Christian fundamentalists against Holzinger\u2019s works have only added to the hype. All Berlin performances of A Year without Summer were sold out within minutes of its announcement. Holzinger\u2019s shows have enormous budgets and are always co-productions involving several institutions around the globe. Her latest co-producers include Factory International, in Manchester, and Rising Melbourne, where the piece will be shown at a later time. But what is this fascination all about? How can we obsess over bleeding dancers when we seem collectively desensitised by news images of war and death? Why do we pay to see naked people taking a shit on a theatre stage? And will they do it again? What I instantly notice about the sets of A Year Without Summer is the absence of the wasteful extravagance usually associated with Holzinger. On-stage swimming pools, helicopters flying in the auditorium \u2013 the decadence of Holzinger\u2019s previous productions is no doubt silently frowned upon by many of her colleagues. Especially in times of drastic austerity that are driving so many artists into poverty, or out of Berlin to more affordable European cities. But also, in terms of sustainability, I wonder if thousands of gallons of water in two giant tanks were really necessary to honour the mother of all water corpses, as the choreographer did in her 2022 play Ophelia\u2019s Got Talent. Necessary, maybe not. But possible, if Holzinger\u2019s profitable name is involved. The scenery of A Year Without Summer consists, in strong contrast, of only a glass box, two trampolines, an inflatable torso and a lot of thick haze. Holzinger\u2019s new minimalism sharpens the focus on her narrative. The story unfolds in 1816, the year after a volcano erupted in today\u2019s Indonesia and changed the global climate for years to come. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, so we are told, under the ashy sky of that very first year without summer. The blend of an apocalyptic atmosphere and the creation of artificial humans is a perfect backdrop to what Holzinger and her team seem most interested in: grotesque interventions in the body. We witness butchering doctors, a fake birth out of Holzinger\u2019s own cut-open thigh (\u201cIt\u2019s a musical!\u201d) and an ultimate facelift performed on a dancer hung by meat hooks piercing through their cheeks and temples. All of this is undeniably hard to watch, but also beautifully staged, like a Renaissance painting. Personal hospital stories told by cast members are merged with musical performances about racist medical science and eugenics. Immortality as the main goal of future medicine is discussed as both a conviction and salvation. Even Freud comes on stage to perform his trashy horror of the vagina, examining and declaring it as a wound caused by castration. There is really nothing subtle about that. The omnipresent question still remains compelling enough: aren\u2019t we all monsters anyway? But then there is also tenderness, which is new to Holzinger\u2019s work and makes this play especially intriguing. This time, the undressing of the cast is part of the performance. The imminent apocalypse at the beginning of the story gives way to a very long romantic intro, with couples dancing slowly, cuddling, making out, until they finally lie on top of each other naked and simulate an orgy. If the world was to end tomorrow, the play suggests, we should come close and warm each other. Particularly when the caresses are not of an erotic nature, they deliver much-needed utopian moments, between all the splatter and jokey scenes. Several cast members are elderly people in wheelchairs, who towards the end of the show are being cared for affectionately by other dancers, whose props indicate they are nurses and doctors. This quite extensive scene of generosity and gratitude gets suspiciously heartwarming, until the patients start defecating in streams and turn this idyllic moment of compassion into a horror depiction of plain humanness. The mere presence of brown fluids instantly makes us uncomfortable. The nurses start vomiting the same liquid (out of oxygen tubes filled with paint) and get all tangled up while trying to clean up the mess. Tissues of fake faeces are thrown at the audience. Few spectators leave the room. Most are in awe of this incarnation of the contradictory nature of vulnerability: it\u2019s lovable and disgusting and horrifying and banal at the same time. What follows this mess is a very touching climax, the end that says \u201cNo End\u201d on two big screens. All lights stay on. The ambivalent immortality theme is embodied by the 82-year-old former ballerina Beatrice Cordua, who sits in a wheelchair now and has told the audience earlier in the show that she will soon die from lung cancer and how sad she is about it. For the applause, Holzinger pushes Cordua\u2019s wheelchair to the front. A teary-eyed audience gives the terminally ill ballerina a last standing ovation. She blows a kiss at us and leaves, while an ice skater turns endless pirouettes on a small square of ice. We\u2019re not monsters, I think to myself. We are just mortal and fascinated by how ambiguous that feels.

Now the continent-spanning and nigh-forgotten love story of the Burton-Tayloresque couple at the heart of the European avant garde is finally being given its due at a major art institution. And We\u2019ll Never Be Parted, exhibiting at Prague\u2019s Kunsthalle gallery, is the first show to reunite the Norwegian painter Anna-Eva Bergman and German-born Hans Hartung. Consisting of 350 items across two floors, the exhibition features paintings, photographs, tools \u2013 and the extraordinary breakup letter that spelled the pair\u2019s separation but allowed them to remarry as creative equals 15 years later. Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and a Norwegian mother, Bergman trained as an artist in Oslo and Paris, where she and Hartung met and married in 1929 before moving to Dresden. In the early phase of her career she made a living as an illustrator, including of anti-Nazi cartoons. Hartung, born in Leipzig in 1904, was quicker to hit his stride as a serious artist. His idiosyncratic scribbles, swirls and scratch marks helped him achieve international recognition as a key figure of art informel, a largely European counter-movement to American abstract expressionism. Where the action paintings of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning were often violent in their gestures, Hartung executed his ideas in a more controlled manner, preparing his marks with smaller sketches and a grid system. Though single works by each featured in a 1932 group show in Oslo, it was Hartung who enjoyed most of the limelight. In their reviews, some critics referred to Bergman simply as Mrs Hartung. On 14 April 1937, Bergman announced her separation from Hartung in a bluntly phrased letter sent from Sanremo, Italy. While insisting that \u201cthe cause is not another man\u201d, it noted that \u201cfrom an erotic point of view, we are simply not a match\u201d. Above all, what motivated her decision to leave their marriage, she wrote, was the need to develop as an artist in her own right. \u201cI shall thus try to make my way through the world on my own, and I shall succeed. I must be completely free and alone, and above all with a lot of time \u2013 no housework and other worries \u2013 to focus just on my own work while still having time to rest on the side.\u201d Bergman concludes her breakup note with: \u201cMay your art always come first, just as before. It has been your strength and perhaps also (on a human level) your weakness.\u201d After moving back to Norway, she studied ecclesiastical art and the use of gilding, making abstract paintings that drew inspiration from the bleak landscape around her, returning again and again to archetypal natural forms such as mountains, rocks and fjords. \u201cWithout the separation, they wouldn\u2019t have developed as artists in the way they did,\u201d said Theo Carnegy-Tan, one of the show\u2019s curators. \u201cThey needed the time apart.\u201d Having seen communist and Jewish friends \u201cdisappeared\u201d under the Nazis, both artists experienced first-hand the rise of fascism. Bergman went into hiding in the Norwegian countryside to avoid being captured by occupying German forces, while Hartung was interrogated and roughed up by the Gestapo. After war broke out, he refused to serve under the German flag and joined the French foreign legion, later losing a leg after sustaining severe injuries in the Battle of the Vosges in 1944. Confronted with mutilated bodies on the battlefield, and inspired by the Spanish painter Julio Gonz\u00e1lez, whose daughter he married after the breakup from Bergman, he returned briefly to more figurative painting. Yet after writing each other a series of cautious letters, the pair met again for the first time after the end of the war, at a Gonz\u00e1lez retrospective in Paris in 1952. \u201cIt was love at first sight, again,\u201d said co-curator Pierre Wat. In 1961, the remarried couple acquired a plot of land to house their villa-studio in Antibes, southern France, where they expanded their artistic practices. They died two years apart, Bergman in 1987 and Hartung in 1989. While Hartung\u2019s standing as a key figure of abstract expressionism in Europe was advanced immediately after his death, Bergman\u2019s work has been rediscovered only over the past five years. Her first major retrospective was at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris in 2023 and her first solo show at Oslo\u2019s National Museum in 2024. \u201cBergman stood outside the big artistic movements of her time, and it took some time for her reputation to be elevated,\u201d said Carnegy-Tan. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been right for this reunion to take place until they are treated as equals.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/17/prague-exhibition-celebrates-anna-eva-bergman-hans-hartung-europe-avant-garde", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "And We\u2019ll Never Be Parted, exhibiting at Prague\u2019s Kunsthalle gallery, is the first show to reunite the Norwegian painter Anna-Eva Bergman and German-born Hans Hartung.

Is it a good idea?", "content": "When Natalie Rowcroft decided to raffle off her house in Salford, everybody \u2013 including her husband, Bradley Rowcroft \u2013 thought she \u201chad lost the plot\u201d. It was July 2020; people were doing stranger things with their first pandemic summer. But given that she had read a newspaper article about a couple who\u2019d raffled their house in the morning, and had put her own up for sale by the evening, the scepticism was well-founded. \u201cAt first, I wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d says Bradley, a 38-year-old carpenter. It didn\u2019t help that she had also chucked the family car in the draw for good measure. Still, Natalie, 38, a teaching assistant, persevered. She printed out leaflets and put them up all over Salford and Manchester, set up social media accounts to promote the draw and bought a big poster to hang in the couple\u2019s driveway. The Rowcrofts had long dreamed of moving to Australia \u2013 but as the pandemic took hold and the housing market stagnated, it began to look increasingly like a dream that might never get off the ground. It was a story that struck a chord with penned-in Facebook scrollers everywhere: soon, Natalie was staying up into the early hours to field entrants\u2019 questions from around the world. She even began to be recognised \u2013 through her face mask \u2013 in the local supermarket. Rowcroft realised that the more details she shared of the couple\u2019s life on social media, the more tickets they sold on Raffall, the site they used to host the draw. \u201cPeople would drive past and say: \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s the crazy Rowcrofts, raffling off their house,\u2019\u201d she says. Raffall, a UK-based company founded a decade ago, allows sellers to set a minimum ticket threshold, which they must meet for their property to be won. If they don\u2019t sell enough tickets, they can either give 50% of the ticket revenue to the winner and keep 40% themselves, or give away the house anyway and keep more of the proceeds. Naturally, the company gets a cut of the profit in both scenarios \u2013 between 10 and 15%, depending on a seller\u2019s subscription plan. The Rowcrofts, whose house was valued at \u00a3290,000, needed to sell 200,000 tickets at \u00a32 each to pay off their mortgage, cover both sides\u2019 fees and have some cash left over to pay for their flights and visas. The car was just a bonus \u2013 it wasn\u2019t worth the money they would spend shipping it to Brisbane. They gave themselves 90 days but, in the end, managed to meet their ticket threshold in a month-and-a-half. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for those 45 days,\u201d says Natalie. \u201cI lost so much weight. It was the hardest time of my life \u2013 we were living and breathing it.\u201d Much of that effort was expended reassuring people that it wasn\u2019t a scam: \u201cPeople didn\u2019t believe it was actually real.\u201d Neither did the winner when, just a few weeks and \u00a3400,000 worth of tickets later, the raffle company got in touch to tell her she\u2019d won a five bedroom semi-detached house and a white BMW saloon. After the mortgage and both sides\u2019 fees were paid and Raffall had taken its cut, the Rowcrofts pocketed about \u00a390,000. Natalie, who has three children, says the high of getting the competition over the line was \u201clike giving birth\u201d. In the world of online property raffles, if you\u2019re going to do things by halves, you may as well not even bother. *** Property competitions are big business in the UK, but for individual sellers, who are attempting to jostle with professional competition companies such as Raffle House, Tramway Path, Elite Competitions, BOTB and yes, Omaze \u2013 the prize draw giant that has been keeping UK punters in multimillion-pound dream houses since 2020 \u2013 stories such as the Rowcrofts\u2019 are rare. It is not for a lack of trying on the part of plucky sellers, who \u2013 often unable to sell the old-fashioned way \u2013 take matters into their own hands. A far cry from the multimillion pound profits of professional competition companies, many lone rafflers just want to make enough money to pay off their mortgage and move on. \u201cI really wanted it to work,\u201d says Karen Sugden, a 50-year-old HR professional who tried to sell her Dublin flat on Raffall in 2023. A house raffle enthusiast herself (just before we speak, she has entered Tramway Path\u2019s latest competition to win a two-bed flat in south-east London), Sugden, who grew up in Yorkshire, was selling up in order to move to Paris. \u201cProperty in Dublin was and is horribly expensive, so I thought: \u2018This is a nice way for someone to get on the property ladder for a fiver,\u2019\u201d she says. Modest but cosy, the one-bed flat in Kilmainham, on the edge of Phoenix Park, would\u2019ve been a dream for a first-time buyer. Worth about \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3213,000), Sugden had lived there happily for 17 years. \u201cI wanted someone to get that place,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to go to an investor.\u201d Despite her best efforts, the raffle ended when she was within spitting distance of her 120,000 ticket target, the winner got a cash payout \u2013 \u201cstill a life changing amount of money\u201d \u2013 and the flat was subsequently sold to an investor hoping to build on his existing Dublin property portfolio. It\u2019s a grim, if all too familiar, fable about the state of the modern housing market in the UK and Ireland. \u201cThe flat wasn\u2019t huge, but the rental income for it would have been \u20ac1,800 a month,\u201d says Sugden, \u201cwhich is an absolute joke.\u201d Raffall isn\u2019t the only site where individual rafflers can set up shop, but it is one of the most namechecked; last month, Imelda Collins used the platform to raffle her picturesque cottage in Leitrim, Ireland, for \u00a35 a ticket. Thanks to international media coverage and the cottage\u2019s postcard-worthy charm, sales surpassed the minimum threshold of 150,000. Though it\u2019s unknown how many tickets were sold, with the house valued at \u00a3255,000, the prize draw netted a profit of at least \u00a3495,000 \u2013 not bad for a two-bedroom bungalow. \u201cI am not the first to do this and certainly won\u2019t be the last,\u201d Collins told the New York Times a few days before the competition closed. When contacted by the Guardian, she responded that she and the winner, who is thought to be American, are \u201ckeeping a low profile. Letting it all sink in.\u201d \u201cClearly I wasn\u2019t as savvy as Imelda was,\u201d says Sugden. But to what extent does our desire for stories of triumph \u2013 the man who failed to sell his sprawling \u00a3545,000 farmhouse through an estate agent and instead raffled it off to a 23-year-old admin assistant; the newlywed who had multiple sales fall through before he decided to set up his own raffle company \u2013 belie these competitions\u2019 success? Jason Dale, the managing director of raffle curation site Loquax, says that of the Raffall property competitions that his site has listed, just 13% have concluded with a house winner. \u201cI think it\u2019s much harder now for an individual to give away their house than it was back in 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, people were coming along thinking, \u2018Here\u2019s my house in Grimsby or somewhere, I\u2019m going to put it on at \u00a350 a ticket, and I\u2019m going to become a millionaire.\u2019 It just didn\u2019t work.\u201d For one, properties belonging to ordinary sellers \u2013 a (perfectly nice) Sheffield semi-detached; a one-bedroom flat in Aberdeen \u2013 appear almost risibly shabby compared with the palatial houses of Omaze, or the flashy McMansions of Elite Competitions. Then there\u2019s the legwork required to garner the publicity that professional raffle companies inherently attract. \u201cOne thing that people don\u2019t realise when they go to Raffall is that they\u2019ve still got to become influencers,\u201d says Dale, who has listed more than 500 house competitions on Loquax since 2017. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to do all the social media and get the press involved and keep going and going. It\u2019s a really tough task. \u201d Loquax, which earns revenue from raffle companies when entrants click through from its site, has listed 63 house competitions so far this year \u2013 mostly from professional companies. Last year it was 118 \u2013 90 of which resulted in a house win, 23 of which saw a cash payout, one of which was closed without details, two of which were closed with entrants being refunded and two of which are still open. \u201cWhether or not they\u2019re good quality is another question,\u201d says Dale. His job is just to post them. \u201cThe truth of it is that it\u2019s a very long process,\u201d says Mark, who attempted to sell a property on Raffall last year when his marriage ended. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got a load of money to put into Google Ads.\u201d For individual rafflers, the task is not just selling your house, but yourself. \u201cWe had some pretty nasty comments in the papers,\u201d says Mark. \u201cOpening yourself up to that, if you\u2019re just a normal person, isn\u2019t easy, and you don\u2019t get any sort of briefing on it.\u201d Months after his raffle failed to sell enough tickets, \u201call I want to do is sell it and get rid of it now\u201d. Dunstan Low, a 45-year-old artist, was lucky enough to catch the raffle wave at the right time. Actually, he adopted the Omaze model \u2013 introducing free postal entries, so the raffle can be classed as a free draw and escape regulation by the Gambling Commission; donating a cut of the revenue to charity \u2013 before Omaze even arrived in the UK in 2020. Launched in 2017, the raffle to win Low\u2019s Grade II-listed Georgian manor in Lancashire netted \u00a31m in ticket sales after he failed to sell it through an estate agent. A self-described \u201cmortgage prisoner\u201d who was up to his eyeballs in debt, Low had little choice but to get rid of it. \u201cI would have been repossessed and probably divorced,\u201d he says. \u201cAs it is, it wasn\u2019t repossessed \u2026 though I am divorced.\u201d Granted, his then-wife didn\u2019t know that their house was up for raffle until the local paper was already on its way. *** The property raffle industry in the UK is largely unregulated: most raffles are classed as free draws or prize competitions, and do not come under the Gambling Act 2005. Free draws offer free postal entries alongside paid-for online tickets, while prize competitions involve entrants having to answer a question \u2013 one that\u2019s sufficiently difficult to discourage people from entering \u2013 in the vein of daytime TV competitions. Neither require a licence to run. \u201cRaffle sites are right on the border of gambling, really,\u201d says Dale. Many would argue they\u2019re no different. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult \u2013 you hear stories of people spending a lot of money on pay-to-enter sites,\u201d he says. One entrant to Low\u2019s competition bought \u00a310,000 worth of tickets. \u201cSay I spent \u00a3500 on a bingo site \u2013 that might get flagged up,\u201d says Dale. \u201cIf I play on a competition site, it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s a conflict there.\u201d Raffle companies themselves may have eyes on the prize, but the individuals who raffle their properties often do so with a desire to do good. Adam Thwaites, a 40-year-old accountant, raffled his three-bedroom family home in South Shields for \u00a31-a-ticket on Raffall in the hope of raising \u00a350,000 for children\u2019s charity Grace House. While they only managed to raise \u00a33,000 for the charity after ticket sales fell wide of their \u2013 admittedly ambitious \u2013 200,000 mark, they decided to give away their house anyway. \u201cFinancially, it wasn\u2019t worth it, but in the end we just said, \u2018If we get enough to pay off what\u2019s left on the mortgage, we\u2019ll just let someone have it and it doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d he says. They handed over the keys to a 27-year-old from Carlisle who was struggling to get on the property ladder. \u201cWe were going to move anyway,\u201d he shrugs. At least when they work, property raffles can change lives. As for Natalie and Bradley, they\u2019re settling nicely into life in Brisbane. \u201cWe\u2019re just a normal family that followed their dream,\u201d says Natalie. Would they do it again? \u201cNever. Never in a million years.\u201d They\u2019ve kept the sign they had on the house advertising the raffle, though, just in case they change their minds: \u201cIt\u2019s in the garage. I\u2019m like: \u2018Can we just burn it now?\u2019 It\u2019s embarrassing.

Scientists have called for stricter regulation around high-risk farming pesticides and flea treatments for pets because of the deadly effects they have on fish and other aquatic life when they make their way into rivers. The research, by the British Geological Survey, evaluated the pollution by such pesticides in the waters and sediments of two English rivers: the Tone in Somerset, which runs through Taunton; and the Wensum in Norfolk, which runs through Norwich. Scientists from the BGS and the University of Nottingham tested water, sediments, fish and invertebrates along the two rivers for 52 pesticides and found that the veterinary pesticide fipronil, which is used as an anti-flea treatment for dogs, was measured at high concentrations. It is thought to get into rivers by dogs swimming in them, and has been found to be toxic to aquatic life. They also found high concentrations of propiconazole, a fungicide commonly used in agriculture, in the rivers. This has been found to have negative health effects on fish. Cats and dogs are widely treated with insecticides to prevent fleas. Vets often recommend regular flea treatments as a preventive measure, even when dogs and cats do not have the pest. But scientists now recommend animals should not be treated for fleas unless they actually have them. Highly toxic neonicotinoid pesticides, which can be lethal to insects and fish even at very small concentrations, were found in both rivers. At one third of the sites sampled, the level of neonicotinoids exceeded the chronic threshold for aquatic invertebrates, meaning they are affecting the health of these organisms. This data has formed one of the most comprehensive assessments of pesticides in any English river catchment to date. Dr Christopher Vane, head of organic chemistry at BGS, said: \u201cModern chemical pesticides have positive applications, such as veterinary medicines helping prevent fleas in domestic pets, and in UK agriculture where herbicides, insecticides an fungicides can help prevent food shortages by protecting crops from various pests. \u201cHowever, our research has highlighted that these pesticides are now present in English rivers and could potentially pose threats to the local wildlife. To help mitigate the risk to ecosystem health, additional protective measures are needed to promote more environmentally sustainable practices, alongside the introduction of stricter regulation around the most high-risk pesticides to help protect our rivers from further impact.\u201d The researchers said more studies needed to be done on the prevalence of modern pesticides in English rivers and other countries\u2019 waterways, as well as their impact on aquatic life.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/17/dangerous-pesticides-pet-flea-treatment-detected-english-rivers", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Dangerous modern pesticides used in agriculture and pet flea treatment have been detected for the first time in English rivers, research has found.

Jalen Williams erupted for a career playoff-high 40 points, MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 31 points and 10 assists, and the Thunder held off a furious Indiana rally to secure a chance at clinching their first title since 1979 in Game 6 on Thursday in Indianapolis. It was the 10th time this postseason that Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams combined for more than 70 points in a game. Williams was 14-of-25 from the field and added six rebounds and four assists, including several key buckets late in the fourth as the Thunder weathered a Pacers push. \u201cThat was honestly the same exact game as Game 1,\u201d Williams said. \u201cLearning through these finals, that\u2019s what makes a team good.\u201d For three quarters, it looked like the Thunder were learning fast. Oklahoma City led by as many as 18 late in the second quarter and carried a 59\u201345 advantage into half-time. But as they\u2019ve done all postseason, the Pacers clawed back. Indiana, who have has come back from double-digit deficits to win five times during their charmed playoff run, outscored the Thunder 34\u201328 in the third behind a surge from backup point guard TJ McConnell. McConnell scored 13 of his 18 points in just under seven minutes of the third period, helping the Pacers cut the deficit to five. Early in the fourth, Pascal Siakam, who finished with 28 points on 9-of-15 shooting, hit a pair of free throws to bring Indiana within four. A minute later, his three-pointer made it 95\u201393. But Oklahoma City responded with championship mettle. Gilgeous-Alexander drew contact to get to the line and knocked down key free throws, while Williams drilled a three and a mid-range jumper to extend the lead. Cason Wallace and Aaron Wiggins also contributed timely buckets off the bench. The Thunder outscored Indiana 25\u201314 over the next seven minutes to put the game out of reach. Oklahoma City finished with 14 made threes and connected on over 43% of their attempts from beyond the arc while committing just 11 turnovers. Their defense forced 23 Pacers giveaways leading to 32 points, limiting Indiana to just 11-of-30 from deep. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good team over there,\u201d Williams said of the Pacers. \u201cYou just don\u2019t trip into the finals.\u201d Indiana\u2019s hopes took a devastating hit in the form of star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who appeared to aggravate a lingering lower leg injury in the first quarter. He briefly exited and returned with his calf wrapped, but was largely a non-factor offensively. He finished with four points, all on free throws, while missing all six of his shot attempts. It was the first time in his playoff career he was held scoreless in a half. Haliburton added seven rebounds and six assists in 34 minutes, but the Pacers never quite looked the same with their floor general hobbled. The Thunder defense, led by Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort and Isaiah Hartenstein, clamped down and turned missed shots into transition opportunities. Oklahoma City scored 17 fast-break points to Indiana\u2019s 13. Indiana have now lost back-to-back games for the first time since mid-March. It also marks the first time in these playoffs that the Pacers have trailed in a series, having defeated Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York without ever falling behind. The historical odds now favor Oklahoma City, whose first and only NBA title came in 1979, when the team was known as the Seattle Supersonics. Teams that win Game 5 of an NBA finals tied 2\u20132 have gone on to win the title 74% of the time. Teams with a 3\u20132 series lead are 40-9 all-time in finals history.

Iroga said that Pacific countries \u2013 while all distinct and with separate laws governing media \u2013 often face similar cultural and economic challenges that affect press freedom. These include the fact that news outlets are often small with very limited budgets, which means defending lawsuits brought against them can often bankrupt an outlet. Concerns have been raised about press freedom in some Pacific countries in recent years, including in Solomon Islands, where the former prime minister Manasseh Sogavare reportedly threatened to ban foreign journalists in 2022 if they were not \u201crespectful\u201d in stories about the country\u2019s ties with China, and in Papua New Guinea where reporters have been suspended over their coverage of certain political stories. Papua New Guinea is the lowest-ranked Pacific country \u2013 91st in the world \u2013 when it comes to press freedom, according to the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index 2024. \u201cIt limits the ability of a journalist to report, knowing that if they enter into a legal suit, that might destroy the company, because they don\u2019t have money to fight those legal suits which are very expensive,\u201d Iroga said. \u201cThis is a critical moment for us in the Pacific,\u201d he said. \u201cThreats have slowly been creeping in, eroding the freedom of the press.\u201d Among those facing legal action are Leilani Reklai, the publisher of Island Times newspaper in Palau, and the deputy chair of the Pacific Freedom Forum. She is being sued for defamation by Surangel and Sons Co, a company owned by the father of Palau\u2019s president, Surangel Whipps Jr, for an article she published last year about the company\u2019s tax affairs. The company alleged in a statement that Reklai\u2019s article contained \u201cfalse and unsubstantiated allegations against the company\u201d constituting \u201cnegligence and defamation\u201d. Reklai denies this. Reklai\u2019s case is still in the discovery phase and so far she says it has cost her $10,000 in legal fees. She has been told her fees could end up being five times that amount. In Palau, the average salary for a journalist is approximately $9,500 a year before tax. To fund the suit, the local media community has engaged in fundraising for her, but she says her family and her clan may have to sell land to pay the rest of the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful financially and emotionally. But it\u2019s not something that we can afford to just drop or compromise on,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s watching this, reporters are watching this, our community as a whole is watching it to see what message is coming out at the end of the day.\u201d Speaking generally about the challenges of reporting in the Pacific, Reklai said that because communities are often quite small and Pacific cultures often put a premium on respect for authority and reputation, there can be a tendency toward self-censorship. \u201c[There is] a pressure to report only what is acceptable or not culturally or politically too sensitive. There is that sort of self-censorship\u2026 because we know everyone, we are related to everybody in this whole community,\u201d she said. This concern for reputation was a key factor in the re-criminalising of defamation in Samoa in 2017, which means that someone found guilty of defamation could face up to three months in jail. Lagi Keresoma, a veteran journalist at Talamua Media and the president of the Journalists Association of (Western) Samoa (JAWS), is now charged with criminal defamation for a story she wrote in May. Keresoma, who is due to appear in court later this month on the charges, says she will plead not guilty. \u201cAs the president of the media association here, I cannot bow down and set a bad example for others. If I have to go to jail on this one, I\u2019ll take it, but I\u2019m not going to apologise for something [when] I believe there was no wrong in it.\u201d In Papua New Guinea defamation is also a criminal charge, carrying a penalty of up to 25 years. The Pacific Freedom Forum has launched a fundraising appeal to raise money for the defence of these \u2013 and other \u2013 Pacific journalists facing lawsuits. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary, because some of them, if they lose these court cases, it\u2019s basically the end of their business and that will be very sad a chapter for the media industry in this region,\u201d said Iroga. \u201cRegardless of the challenges we face, we are determined across the region to defend press freedom, to defend democracy.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/pacific-faces-critical-moment-in-fight-for-press-freedom-media-watchdog-warns-ntwnfb", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "\u201cWe have seen a few cases coming up \u2026 challenging the fundamentals of press freedom in the region,\u201d said Robert Iroga, the chair of the Pacific Freedom Forum.

An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kickstart broader discussions,\u201d Macron told reporters at the G7. \u201cWe have to see now whether the sides will follow.\u201d Macron described the move as a positive development. \u201cRight now I believe negotiations need to restart and that civilians reed to protected.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t believe things would change in the next few hours, but \u201csince the US assured they will find a ceasefire and since they can pressure Israel, things may change\u201d. Trump told reporters he had to leave early for \u201cobvious reasons\u201d, but later posted that his early exit had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d working on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Trump described his reasons as \u201cmuch bigger than that\u201d in the post on his Truth Social platform. At a morning meeting, Trump confirmed that he had received signals through intermediaries that Iran wants to de-escalate the fighting. Trump, no fan of G7 Summits, decided to fly to Washington to brief his national security council, in doing so avoiding a day in which he would have been pressed over Ukraine and trade by his G7 colleagues. The development came after 48 hours in which several Gulf States attempted to mediate between the US and Iran in a bid to secure a ceasefire and restart nuclear talks that were cancelled by Iran after the surprise attack mounted by Israel. Earlier, in a joint phone call the French German and British foreign ministers urged Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, not to escalate the conflict by attacking the US or other regional players. They also pressed Iran not to go ahead with a new threat to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), a move that could presage an attempt to build a nuclear bomb in the face of its inability to fend off Israeli attacks. The ministers also urged Iran to withdraw its threat to reduce cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA. The trio warned escalation will only cut Iran off from the remaining path back to diplomacy. At the same time some European officials admitted ahead of the call they had no guarantees Trump would press Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to cease what was proving to be a devastatingly successful assault on the whole Iranian security apparatus. Iran had said it will reopen talks with the US on its nuclear program only once Washington orders Israel to stop its bombing campaign. Some European officials admitted they could not be sure whether Trump still wanted to reach a diplomatic deal with Iran or had irrevocably, if covertly, committed to backing Israel\u2019s efforts to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear program through force. A G7 leaders statement issued late on Monday urged de-escalation, but reiterated Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d and labelled Iran \u201cthe principal source of regional instability and terror.\u201d \u201cWe will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability,\u201d the statement said. Trump in a social media post called on Iranians to evacuate the capital Tehran, a city of 10 million people suggesting the president was not putting any brakes on the Israeli government. Israel has been pressing for the US to join the assault, but there was no clear indication that Trump\u2019s return to Washington was a prelude to direct US military action. The White House and the Pentagon strongly played down any suggestion that the US was about to join the conflict, saying instead the US was maintaining its defensive posture. In his comments backing a ceasefire, Macron said any attempt at regime change through force would be a strategic error.

Through the haze of heavy medication she was trying to tell the woman at the end of the phone line \u2013 an officer at Centrelink \u2013 what had happened. On 26 March, the 43-year-old had started experiencing psychosis and two weeks later, on 8 April, she was admitted to Macquarie hospital in New South Wales. \u201cI was completely out of my mind,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cWhen I had the psychosis, I thought I was being poisoned and people were watching me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even tell you my name. I didn\u2019t think my name was my name, I was completely just in another world.\u201d While Kelly was unwell her sole source of income \u2013 her jobseeker payment \u2013 was suspended because she had missed a face-to-face appointment with her provider, CoAct. In March, Services Australia paused most of the payment cancellations because of concerns the IT system might not have been operating lawfully. But every month, payments for tens of thousands of recipients are still being suspended, government data shows. Between January and April this year, there were 157,680 payment suspensions. In February, the highest month for suspensions this year, for every minute, more than one recipient had their payments paused. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Advocates allege the suspensions may be unlawful and have called for the federal government to overhaul the mutual obligations framework, where jobseekers are penalised if they don\u2019t fulfil tasks such as attending meetings and submitting job applications. In Kelly\u2019s case, her hospital doctors wrote four medical certificates but all of them were rejected. Kelly says Centrelink told her that psychosis wasn\u2019t a diagnosis but rather a \u201cmedical symptom\u201d and as such, did not count. So she called her job coach at CoAct and was told to attend a face-to-face appointment to get her payment restored. Kelly\u2019s driving licence had been revoked while she was under the Mental Health Act, so the hospital social worker drove her to the provider\u2019s office. She says that in the meeting, her job coach suggested she look for eight jobs a fortnight, instead of six, but her manager kept her plan as it was. \u201cI was getting my cognitive availability back slowly at that point.

During the two weeks, she had no income and was unable to pay her rent. Kelly\u2019s is not an isolated case. Last year, Guardian Australia revealed a Victorian-based welfare recipient had his payment suspended while he was in hospital after surgery to remove a brain tumour. He was also homeless. This week, the Commonwealth Ombudsman confirmed it had expanded the scope of its investigation into the legality surrounding payment cancellations, although it would not provide any more details. In March, the secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, Natalie James, said she had \u201creasonable concerns that the system may not be operating in accordance with the law\u201d and extended the pause on cancellations. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson Jay Coonan says the question of legality \u201calso surrounded payment suspensions\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of cases of people in ICU having their payment suspended,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of people who have been on their deathbed and their families have been working with social support in hospitals to try and stop this from happening.\u201d In April, there were 877,355 registered people on jobseeker, with the majority (625,140) receiving the full rate of $781.10 a fortnight. Coonan says suspensions are stressful and could further throw people into poverty, even when they aren\u2019t in hospital. He wants the government to pause the whole system. \u201cThe issue with mutual obligations is that these suspensions are [allegedly] happening unlawfully, and the department does not really, quite frankly, give a damn.\u201d In a response, department spokesperson Hank Jongen said Centrelink had apologised to Kelly and had \u201cworked with her to resolve this matter\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping people access our payments and services whenever they need them, and we encourage anyone in a situation like this to please contact us so our staff can help,\u201d he said.

Our position is that we should have no tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States,\u201d Kirsten Hillman, Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, told reporters after Carney met Trump. \u201cWe will continue to talk until we find a deal that is the best deal we can achieve for Canada,\u201d Hillman said. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 meeting on Monday to discuss import auto tariffs Washington imposed on Japan, Reuters is reporting. Tokyo is urging Washington to drop the tariffs because they threaten to slow Japan\u2019s economy, the Japanese government said. Ishiba wants Trump to end the 25% auto tariff he imposed on Japanese cars and a 24% reciprocal tariff paused until July 9. Trump has fired a Democratic commissioner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the agency that is in charge of Nuclear safety, according to the AP. Christopher Hanson wrote in a statement that he was fired without cause \u201ccontrary to existing law and longstanding precedent regarding removal of independent agency appointees.\u201d White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the AP that \u201call organizations are more effective when leaders are rowing in the same direction\u201d and that the Republican president reserves the right to \u201cremove employees within his own executive branch.\u201d Hanson\u2019s term was due to end in 2029. He was originally nominated to be the head of the NRC by Trump in 2020 and was appointed chair by President Biden in 2021. After Trump was inaugurated the second time, Hanson was replaced as chair by the president\u2019s newest pick, David Wright, a Republican member of the NRC. Hanson had remained on the NRC as a commissioner. Patrick Wintour and Peter Walker in Banff European leaders at the G7 summit in Canada are trying to engineer an Iranian return to the negotiating table using Gulf leaders as intermediaries. But Iran is demanding a joint ceasefire with Israel, while Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is resisting the move, and Donald Trump praised the Israeli campaign, suggesting he did not yet believe it was time to relieve the pressure on Iran. The US is considered by Iran to be critical to putting pressure on Israel, but the US president wants indications that Iran will back down on wanting to maintain the right to enrich uranium. He is willing to continue to use the Israeli assault as a bargaining chip if necessary. French, German and British foreign ministers were due collectively to speak to the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in an attempt to see if Iran would meet the US demand to end all uranium enrichment in the country, previously a red line for Tehran. Asked if he had received any messages from Iran suggesting that it wanted to de-escalate the conflict, Trump hinted that he had: \u201cThey want to talk.\u201d The US president said that Iran was not winning its conflict with Israel and should re-enter negotiations \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late\u201d. \u201cThey have to make a deal, and it\u2019s painful for both parties, but I\u2019d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Trump told reporters at the summit. He added: \u201cIf Iran wants to negotiate, now is the time.\u201d Araghchi appealed to Trump to break with Netanyahu, telling the US president he was being played by an Israeli leader who was determined to scuttle a deal that Iran and the US were on the verge of sealing. He said: By all indications, the purpose of Netanyahu\u2019s criminal attack on Iran \u2013 killing hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children \u2013 is to scuttle a deal between Iran and the US, which we were on the right path to achieve. He is playing yet another American president, and ever more American taxpayers, for absolute fools. If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential. Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy. Further to my earlier post, Britain and the United States should finalize \u201cvery soon\u201d the implementation of a trade deal agreed last month, Keir Starmer has said ahead of a meeting with Donald Trump in Canada. On the sidelines of the G7 summit, Starmer told reporters: I\u2019m certainly seeing President Trump today, and I\u2019m going to discuss with him our trade deal. I\u2019m very pleased that we made that trade deal, and we\u2019re in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon. The UK was the first country to agree a framework deal for lower tariffs from Trump, with the US reducing tariffs on imports of UK cars, aluminium and steel, and Britain agreeing to lower tariffs on US beef and ethanol. But implementation of the deal has been delayed while details were being hammered out. The proclamation readied by the White House will set an effective date in coming weeks, a source told Reuters. On steel and aluminum, the US agreed to lower the 25% tariffs on imports from Britain to zero, subject to setting a quota for British steel imports that must meet supply chain requirements. Britain had avoided tariffs of up to 50% on steel and aluminum that the US imposed on other countries earlier this month, but could face elevated tariffs from 9 July unless a deal to implement the tariff reduction is reached. The US justice department has asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging race-conscious admissions at the US Naval Academy after the elite military school said it changed its policy under Donald Trump. The Naval Academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, disclosed in March that it was no longer considering race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions following directives from Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth. The justice department and an anti-affirmative action group that had sued the academy, jointly told the court today that the policy change rendered the legal dispute moot. \u201cThis Department is committed to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity throughout the federal government,\u201d attorney general Pam Bondi said in a statement. The filing, in the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit, also asks the court to vacate a federal judge\u2019s ruling last year finding that the prior race-conscious policy was legal. The Biden administration defended affirmative action at the Naval Academy after the US supreme court exempted US military academies from its 2023 ruling barring consideration of race in college admissions. The Naval Academy had long relied on its prior policy to raise its enrollment of Black, Hispanic and other minorities. US conservatives and the Trump administration have argued that such policies disadvantage white and certain other applicants and do not improve military readiness. Reuters is reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign a proclamation finalizing a US-UK trade deal in the coming days, citing sources who say the proclamation will cover autos, beef, ethanol and steel. We\u2019ll bring you more detail on this as we get it. The trading framework was agreed in early May and earlier this month we reported that Keir Starmer hoped it would come into effect \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. US House speaker Mike Johnson said he has postponed his planned 22 June trip to Israel to address its parliament, as an escalating battle between Israel and Iran has raised fears of a broader conflict. \u201cDue to the complex situation currently unfolding in Iran and Israel, [Knesset] Speaker [Amir] Ohana and I have made the decision to postpone the special session of the Knesset. We look forward to rescheduling the address in the near future and send our prayers to the people of Israel and the Middle East,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. French president Emmanuel Macron spoke at length with Donald Trump on tariffs and the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, a French presidential official told Reuters. The official did not give further details on the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the G7 summit. The American Bar Association has sued the Trump administration, seeking an order that would bar the White House from pursuing what the ABA called a campaign of intimidation against major law firms. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC, said the administration violated the US Constitution in a series of executive orders targeting law firms over their past clients and lawyers they hired. \u201cThere has never been a more urgent time for the ABA to defend its members, our profession and the rule of law itself,\u201d the group\u2019s president, William Bay, said in a statement. The ABA, with about 150,000 paying members, is the country\u2019s largest voluntary association for lawyers. A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment. Four law firms have separately sued the administration over Donald Trump\u2019s orders, which stripped their lawyers of security clearances and restricted their access to government officials and federal contracting work. Four different judges in Washington have sided with the firms and temporarily or permanently barred Trump\u2019s orders against them. One of the firms that sued and won a preliminary victory, Susman Godfrey, is representing the ABA in Monday\u2019s lawsuit. Despite Trump\u2019s court losses, nine law firms have struck deals with the president, pledging nearly $1bn in free legal services on mutually agreed legal issues with the White House in order to stave off similar executive orders. The ABA said in its lawsuit that Trump\u2019s actions had made it difficult to find law firms willing to represent it in litigation adverse to the federal government, including a case it sought to join challenging the administration\u2019s immigration policies. The ABA said Trump had formed a \u201cdeliberate policy designed to intimidate and coerce law firms and lawyers to refrain from challenging the President or his Administration in court\u201d. Reuters reports that prosecutors said notebooks recovered from Boelter\u2019s car, as well as the home where he had been staying, showed that he had meticulously planned the attacks for some time. He had the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials \u2013 \u201cmostly or all Democrats\u201d \u2013 according to an affidavit from an FBI agent. Boelter\u2019s notes indicated he had used a variety of people-finding websites to track down addresses. In one notebook, Boelter noted that the Hortmans had two children and included details about their house, writing: \u201cBig house off golf course 2 ways in to watch from one spot,\u201d the affidavit said. Hours after the shootings, with police searching for him, Boelter met an individual at a bus stop in Minneapolis and offered to buy his electric bicycle, according to prosecutors. After the two went to the person\u2019s house, Boelter instead offered to buy his Buick. Investigators on Sunday found the Buick in rural Sibley county, near his listed home address about an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Minneapolis. Inside the car, officers found a handwritten letter to the FBI, in which Boelter gave his name and admitted to committing the shootings, according to the affidavit. More than 20 Swat teams combed the area, aided by surveillance aircraft, officials said. Boelter, who was armed, crawled from a wooded area and surrendered to police in a field with no shots fired. The killing was the latest in a series of high-profile episodes of political violence across the country, including a 2022 attack on former Democratic US House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband at their home, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump last year and an arson attack at Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro\u2019s house in April. Minnesota governor Tim Walz said after Boelter\u2019s arrest: This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences. The Minnesota attacks began around 2am on Saturday, when a gunman wearing a police-style tactical vest knocked on the Hoffmans\u2019 door in Champlin, announced himself as a police officer and then shot the couple multiple times inside, according to prosecutors. He was driving an SUV outfitted with police-style lights and a fake license plate that read \u201cPOLICE.\u201d Boelter then traveled to the home of another state lawmaker in Maple Grove, where he rang the doorbell at 2.24am, Thompson said. The official was not home at the time. Boelter also visited the home of a legislator in New Hope, prosecutors said. A New Hope officer \u2013 dispatched to the house to conduct a wellness check after police learned of the Hoffman shooting \u2013 took Boelter, who was parked outside, to be another police officer and pulled up next to him. \u201cHe just sat there and stared straight ahead,\u201d Thompson said of Boelter. The responding officer went to the door to wait for additional officers, and Boelter had left by the time they arrived, prosecutors said. Shortly after, police went to the Hortmans\u2019 house in Brooklyn Park as a precaution. The arriving officers saw the suspect shoot Mark Hortman through an open door around 3.35am and exchanged fire with him before he fled on foot out the back door, according to prosecutors. Melissa Hortman was already dead inside. When police searched Boelter\u2019s SUV after the shootings, they discovered three AK-47 assault rifles, a 9mm handgun, a gold police-style badge and the target list, according to authorities. The suspect in the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband this weekend drove to the homes of two other state politicians before he succeeded in killing one of the targets of his carefully planned attack, federal authorities said today. Vance Boelter, 57, faces state and federal charges of murder after he was arrested on Sunday night following a massive two-day manhunt that was the largest in state history. He is charged with fatally shooting Melissa Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, Mark, in their home on Saturday. Boelter is also accused of shooting and wounding another Democratic lawmaker, state senator John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette, in their home a few miles away. Prosecutors said Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers on Saturday while disguised as a police officer, apparently targeting more victims. Investigators have said they discovered a list in his car that included the names of dozens of legislators. Boelter was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder in Hennepin County. The county\u2019s chief prosecutor, Mary Moriarty, said at a news conference today that her office would seek first-degree murder charges, which carry a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Federal prosecutors separately charged Boelter with an array of crimes, including murder, which could lead to a death sentence. \u201cPolitical assassinations are rare,\u201d Joseph Thompson, Minnesota\u2019s acting US attorney, said at a news conference today. \u201cThey strike at the very core of our democracy.\u201d Boelter is expected to make an initial appearance in federal court on Monday afternoon. A federal judge has said she would issue a brief extension of an order temporarily blocking Donald Trump\u2019s plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the US to study at Harvard University while she decides whether to issue a longer-term injunction. US district judge Allison Burroughs, at the end of a hearing in Boston in Harvard\u2019s legal challenge to the restrictions, extended to 23 June a temporary restraining order that had been set to expire on Thursday. She said she wanted to give herself more time to prepare a ruling, adding: We\u2019ll kick out an opinion as soon as we can. Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told her that an injunction was necessary to ensure the Trump administration could not implement his latest bid to curtail the school\u2019s ability to host international students. The judge scheduled the hearing after issuing a temporary restraining order on 6 June preventing the administration from implementing a proclamation that Trump had signed a day earlier. A preliminary injunction would provide longer-term relief to Harvard. Gershengorn argued Trump signed the proclamation to retaliate against Harvard in \u201cplan violation\u201d of its free speech rights under the Constitution\u2019s first amendment for refusing to accede to his administration\u2019s demands to control the school\u2019s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students. The proclamation is a plain violation of the first amendment. Donald Trump does not intend to sign a G7 statement related to Israel and Iran, CBS News reports, citing unnamed US officials. A draft document discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians and for commitments to peace, according to the news outlet. The US military has moved a large number of refueling aircraft to Europe to provide options to Donald Trump as Middle East tensions soar, two US officials have told Reuters. The officials also said the US aircraft carrier Nimitz was heading to the Middle East, although one official said the movement was pre-planned. Trump once again complained about removing Russia from what was once the G8. Russia used to be a part of the exclusive club of major economies but was kicked out following its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \u201cThe G7 used to be the G8. Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn\u2019t want to have Russia in,\u201d Trump said, referring to former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. And I would say that was a mistake, because I think you wouldn\u2019t have a war right now if you had Russia in and you wouldn\u2019t have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago. Trump says Iran wants to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, and he advises that they should do so immediately \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Trump told reporters at the start of the G7 summit meeting with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney. Trump reiterated unfounded claims that immigrants are intentionally being placed in cities in the US to bolster votes for Democratic candidates. He also repeated false claims that the majority of immigrants are criminals. \u201cBiden allowed 21 million people to come into our country, of that the vast number of those people are murderous killers, people from gangs, people from jails. They empty jails out into the US,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMost of those people are in the cities, all blue cities, all Democrat-run cities, and they think they\u2019re going to use them to vote, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Trump has kicked off the G7 summit by meeting with Canada\u2019s prime minister. Carney began the summit by welcoming President Trump and wishing him a belated birthday. In an unusual twist, Trump is seated in a chair in front of the Canadian flag, while Carney is seated in front of a US flag. Keir Starmer says he\u2019ll hold a one-on-one meeting with President Trump on Monday about finalizing the UK-US trade deal the leaders agreed to in May. Starmer said he\u2019ll meet Trump on the margins of a G7 summit in Canada, \u201cand I\u2019m going to discuss with him our trade deal\u201d. The British leader said the agreement is \u201cin the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon\u201d. The deal agreed last month would bring down import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for US products including beef and ethanol. But it has yet to take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the UK could face any surprise hikes from Trump. Keir Starmer said he believed there was a consensus at the G7 summit in Canada on the need for de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a consensus for de-escalation. Obviously, what we need to do today is to bring that together and to be clear about how it is to be brought about,\u201d the British prime minister told reporters. Iran has been urgently signaling that it seeks an end to hostilities and resumption of talks over its nuclear programs, sending messages to Israel and the US via Arab intermediaries, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing officials. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. You can follow all the latest from the Middle East over on our live blog: Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he plans to discuss new weapons purchases for Ukraine with Donald Trump at the G7 summit. The Ukrainian president, who is visiting Austria, is to attend the G7 summit in Canada on Tuesday, where he hopes to meet Trump on the sidelines of the meeting. \u201cOne of the questions that I will discuss with President Trump during the meeting is the defence package that Ukraine is ready to buy,\u201d Zelenskyy told a news conference in Vienna. Russia has said that the United States has cancelled the next round of talks between the two countries, an apparent setback in a process launched by presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump to improve bilateral ties. In a statement, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova did not say if Washington had given any reason for the break in the talks, which began after Trump returned to the White House in January. \u201cAs of today, the next meeting within the framework of bilateral consultations on eliminating \u2018irritants\u2019 in order to normalize the activities of diplomatic missions of both countries has been cancelled at the initiative of the American negotiators,\u201d Zakharova said. \u201cWe hope that the pause they have taken will not last too long.\u201d Reuters reports that Russia had said only last week that the US-Russia talks \u2013 which have been proceeding on a separate track from discussions about ending the war in Ukraine \u2013 would soon move to Moscow from Istanbul. However, the Kremlin \u2013 while denying that dialogue had stalled \u2013 also said last week that there were \u201ca lot of blockages in bilateral relations\u201d and talks on improving them were not expected to yield quick results. Both sides say there is huge potential for business and investment deals if relations improve. But Trump, despite holding five phone calls with Putin \u2013 most recently on Saturday \u2013 has voiced frustration about Russia\u2019s war actions in Ukraine and the lack of any visible progress towards a peace deal. Donald Trump will begin the first full day of his trip to Canada with a meeting with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, according to NBC News. The meeting comes amid continuing heightened trade tensions and Trump\u2019s referring to Canada in the past as the 51st US state. The two leaders previously held a remarkably cordial meeting at the White House in May. Trump will then head into G7 sessions, which are taking place in Alberta, where world leaders will discuss top international issues. A man accused of killing a Democratic state lawmaker while posing as a police officer is expected to appear in a Minnesota court this afternoon on state murder charges. Vance Boelter, 57, is being held in Hennepin county after he was arrested on Sunday following a huge manhunt over the weekend. Boelter is accused of shooting dead Melissa Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota house, and her husband, Mark, in their home on Saturday. Authorities said Boelter was also suspected of shooting and wounding another Democratic lawmaker, state senator John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette at their home a few miles away. The Trump Organization has launched a self-branded mobile service and a $499 smartphone, dubbed Trump Mobile, signaling a new effort to court conservative consumers with a wireless service positioned as an alternative to major telecom providers. The new mobile venture will include call centers based in the United States and phones made in America, the organization said. \u201cWe are going to be introducing an entire package of products where people can come and they can get telemedicine on their phones for one flat monthly fee, roadside assistance on their cars, unlimited texting to 100 countries around the world,\u201d said the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, announcing the product at Trump Tower in New York. Per NBC News, \u201cthe venture is the latest example of Trump\u2019s business empire capitalizing on its association with the sitting president\u201d. Indeed, during his second term, we\u2019ve already seen the likes of branded Bibles, gold \u201cNever Surrender\u201d hi-top sneakers and $100,000 watches. Reuters reports that a website that went live after the announcement included details of the new Trump-branded smartphone that will be available from September, and a $47.45 a month subscription plan to the new network. DTTM Operations - the entity managing Donald Trump\u2019s trademarks - has filed applications to use his name and the term \u201cT1\u201d for telecom-related services. The filings, submitted on Thursday to the US Patent and Trademark Office, cover mobile phones, accessories like cases and chargers, wireless telephone services, and possibly even retail stores. On the website, the \u201cT1\u201d smartphone appears to feature a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. What\u2019s more, both the name of the wireless service - \u201cThe 47 Plan\u201d and its monthly price are references to Trump, who was the 45th US president during his first term and is now serving as the 47th. More than 60 million smartphones are purchased annually by American consumers, but nearly all of these devices are manufactured abroad \u2014 primarily in China, South Korea, and increasingly in India and Vietnam. Despite the strength of US-based tech brands, there is no significant domestic smartphone production infrastructure, largely due to high labor costs, supply chain complexity, and reliance on overseas component sourcing. The launch of Trump Mobile comes after Trump in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones if they are not made in the United States, as he stepped up the pressure on Apple to build its signature product in the country. Trump said in a post on Truth Social: I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US. Trump then said that he would also impose a 25% tariff on Samsung and any other phone manufacturer that makes phones outside of the US, or, he said, \u201cit would not be fair\u201d. He told reporters at the White House: When they build their plant here, there\u2019s no tariffs. So they\u2019re going to be building plants here. US stock index futures rose on Monday as easing oil prices boosted sentiment despite ongoing attacks between Israel and Iran, while investors focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Wall Street indexes shed more than 1% on Friday as oil prices surged 7% after Israel and Iran traded air strikes, feeding investor worries that the combat could widely disrupt oil exports from the Middle East. Leaders from the Group of Seven nations began annual talks on Monday. The dangers of further escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict loomed over the meeting, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope on Sunday that a deal could be done, but no signs of the fighting abating on the fourth day of war. As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They\u2019re more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid. The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks. Doctors at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals nationwide could refuse to treat unmarried veterans and Democrats under new hospital guidelines imposed following an executive order by Donald Trump. The new rules, obtained by the Guardian, also apply to psychologists, dentists and a host of other occupations. They have already gone into effect in at least some VA medical centers. Medical staff are still required to treat veterans regardless of race, color, religion and sex, and all veterans remain entitled to treatment. But individual workers are now free to decline to care for patients based on personal characteristics not explicitly prohibited by federal law. Read the full piece here: Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept US tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union\u2019s exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday. Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to US counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent. Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US -made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for U.S. manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe. The EU\u2019s position comes partly from the realisation that US President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts. A federal judge is set to consider on Monday whether to extend an order blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. US District Judge Allison Burroughs during a hearing in Boston will weigh whether to issue an injunction barring Trump\u2019s administration from implementing his latest bid to curtail Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students while the university\u2019s lawsuit challenging the restrictions plays out. Almost 6,800 international students attended Harvard in its most recent school year, making up about 27% of the student population of the prestigious school located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. China and India are among the top countries of origin for these students. The judge scheduled the hearing after issuing a temporary restraining order on June 6 preventing the administration from implementing a proclamation that Trump had signed a day earlier. A bright spark in the Canadian team preparing the G7 Kananaskis summit, in the ridiculously beautiful Canadian Rockies, decided to insert the issue of wildfires onto a crowded agenda. It seemed an eminently sensible and Canadian thing for the eminently sensible Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, to do. After all there are currently an estimated 225 blazes in Canada, including 120 classified as out of control, and they are raging to the west in British Columbia across to northern parts of Alberta. Indeed it is likely to be Canada\u2019s second worst year on record for wildfires. Moreover, Carney had an ingenious solution ready to hand \u2013 a Kananaskis wildfire charter including \u201cgreater equipment interoperability\u201d between the G7 members. But unfortunately wildfires were already on the G7 agenda, albeit in an altogether broader, even more existential sense. Read Patrick Wintour\u2019s analysis from Banff: The man suspected of opening fire on two Minnesota legislators and their spouses on 14 June, killing one legislator and her husband, was apprehended late on Sunday night and charged with two counts of murder and two of attempted murder, the state\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, said at a news conference. Vance Boelter, 57, is suspected of fatally shooting the Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, at their residence early on Saturday. Boelter is also suspected of shooting the state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home, seriously injuring them. Read our full report here: Foreign investment into the US could be threatened by Donald Trump\u2019s new \u201crevenge\u201d taxes, analysts have warned. A provision within the president\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will allow the US to apply higher taxes on foreign individuals, businesses and investors connected to jurisdictions that impose \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on US individuals and companies. Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange could choose to avoid the measure by redomiciling in New York. Read the full report here: A Democratic senator introduced legislation on Monday to prevent US President Donald Trump from using military force against Iran without Congress\u2019s authorization, as an escalating battle between Israel and Iran raised fears of broader conflict. Tim Kaine of Virginia has tried for years to wrest back Congress\u2019s authority to declare war from the White House. During Trump\u2019s first term, in 2020, Kaine introduced a similar resolution to rein in Trump\u2019s ability to wage war against Iran. That measure passed both the Senate and House of Representatives, winning some Republican support, but did not garner enough votes to survive the Republican president\u2019s veto. Kaine said his latest war powers resolution underscores that the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the sole power to declare war and requires that any hostility with Iran be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for the use of military force. She finds the whole idea absurd. To Prof Marci Shore, the notion that the Guardian, or anyone else, should want to interview her about the future of the US is ridiculous. She\u2019s an academic specialising in the history and culture of eastern Europe and describes herself as a \u201cSlavicist\u201d, yet here she is, suddenly besieged by international journalists keen to ask about the country in which she insists she has no expertise: her own. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of baffling,\u201d she says. Marci Shore made news around the world when her family moved to Canada. With Jonathan Freedland, she discusses Trump, teaching history and how terror atomises society: A custody photo has been released of the man suspected of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another, who crawled to officers in surrender Sunday after they located him in the woods near his home, ending a massive, nearly two-day search that put the entire state on edge. Vance Boelter was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. Investors are gearing up for key central bank meetings this week, with a particular eye on the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, as well as talks with Washington aimed at avoiding Donald Trump\u2019s sky-high tariffs. At the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies, the Middle East crisis will be discussed along with trade in light of Trump\u2019s tariff blitz. Investors are also awaiting bank policy meetings, with the Fed and BoJ the standouts. Both are expected to stick to their decisions for now but traders will be keeping a close watch on their statements for an idea about the plans for interest rates, with US officials under pressure from Trump to cut. Good morning and welcome to our US politics blog When Donald Trump last came to Canada for a G7 summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him. If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions. Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China\u2019s continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains. So it looks like the Trump, and the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Canada are in for a busy time. Stay with us for all the developments: In other news: The man suspected of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers, killing one of them and her husband, has been taken into custody, two law enforcement officials said. Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday evening. Trump has directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities after large protests have erupted in Los Angeles and other major cities against his administration\u2019s immigration policies. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that Greenland is \u201cnot to be sold\u201d nor \u201cto be taken\u201d in a key visit to the strategic Arctic territory coveted by Trump The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers\u2019 meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems. There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military. \u201cThe Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump\u2019s team for the G7 in Trump\u2019s first term.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jun/16/g7-summit-donald-trump-trade-tariffs-iran-israel-crisis-us-politics-live-news-updates", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Here\u2019s what happened today: Donald Trump is leaving the G7 Summit early and return to Washington DC on Monday. \u201cYou probably see what I see and I have to be back as soon as I can,\u201d Trump said in an apparent nod to the intensifying conflict in the Middle East.

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump would participate in the G7 family photo and would dine with leaders at the summit in Alberta, Canada, before travelling back a day ahead of schedule. Trump\u2019s abrupt change in plans comes after a series of developments in the Israel-Iran conflict and a Truth Social post by the president warning residents in Iran\u2019s capital of Tehran to immediately evacuate. The ominous warning from Trump followed an evacuation order issued earlier in the day by Israeli forces telling residents in large parts of Tehran to evacuate ahead of imminent bombing of \u201cmilitary infrastructure\u201d. Trump\u2019s early departure is a blow to G7 organizers who had sought to discuss the conflict in the Middle East and were hoping for the US to be a signatory to a statement calling on both sides to de-escalate. A draft of the statement said Iran can never possess a nuclear weapon, Israel has a right to defend itself and Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program is subject to a negotiated deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. \u201cAMERICA FIRST means many GREAT things, including the fact that, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d Trump said in a post after his schedule change was announced. Trump also suggested he was coming under more pressure to mediate in the conflict. \u201cThey want to make a deal and as soon as I leave here, we\u2019re going to be doing something. But I have to leave here,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s always better to talk in person.\u201d The rapid succession of events raised concerns in Washington about the possibility of the US being dragged into the conflict or its potential to trigger a broader war in the region. Israel\u2019s bombing runs started with attacks on air defenses, nuclear sites and the military chain of command. But four days into the campaign, it appears to have drifted into war of attrition. And in another ominous escalation on Monday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also said that killing Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would \u201cend the conflict\u201d. After the surprise Israeli attack on Friday, Iran has carried out retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli cities, focusing on the most populated areas between Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa, and threatened to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The US has not been directly involved in the conflict, but on Monday, the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group was rerouted from the South China Sea to the Middle East, a move that put two US carriers in the region. The Nimitz is likely to reach the Middle East later this week and join the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group, a person familiar with the matter said. Two destroyers in the Mediterranean have also been moved closer to Israel in recent days to help protect US assets in the region.

On a violently hot Monday night in Miami Gardens, day three of Fifa\u2019s sport-style entertainment event, something unexpected happened. A football match broke out. And not just the styling, the outlines, the aesthetic sense of a football match. As Boca Juniors tore into a 2-0 first half lead against Benfica, as the stadium interior was transformed into a sustained static field by the Boca fans, as the coaching staff on both benches leapt up in random rotation, like the world\u2019s angriest improv night, this already felt like the real thing, blood, vim, borrowed life. The final score was 2-2 thanks to a late equaliser scored by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, who hovered powerfully before butting the ball into the Boca net from a corner. At which point the air seemed to shoot out through the powder blue gap in the stadium roof, as the entire Benfica squad leapt up to caper about on the pitch, an impressive feat in itself given the overall effect of the afternoon heat is like trying to walk across the surface of the planet Mercury in a Victorian diving suit made from loft insulation. There were three red cards by then, one for each set of players, one for a furious Ander Herrera on the Boca bench. And Boca will be hugely disappointed to let slip a 2-0 lead having played with a sustained, bruising fury for most of the first half. This was the opening game in Group C for both of these teams, and a crunch moment too, a chance to slipstream Bayern Munich towards the knockout phase. For all that this felt like a self-contained event from the start as the Boca fans took ownership of the day and the space, parking themselves like a mobile city state in the home of the Miami Dolphins and putting on a kind of faux-clasico in south Florida. The three hours before kick-off had seen the blue and yellow shirts streaming in across the vast sunken surrounds of the Hard Rock, all sandy scrub and baked tarmac, and decorated now with names like Riquleme, Cavani and Carlitos. The day before had seen a mass gathering in Miami beach, the Boca fans drinking fernet and coke, grilling great flapping skirts of meat, and subjected also to a flying banter banner reading, in Spanish, \u201cRIP YOU DIED IN MADRID 9/12/18\u201d, arranged by some extremely prescient and well organised River Plate fans, and a reference to defeat in the 2018 Copa Libertadores final. The stadium was three quarters full at the start, and packed in the Boca section, which also helpfully drowned out the absurd WWE-style practice of announcing the players one by one, finishing with an ear-shredding field of white noise as Otamendi, a V\u00e9lez Sarsfield man, appeared with the Benfica flag. This was always an interesting basic premise, a meeting of yawningly opposed extremes. Boca are connection, collectivism, passion, an acme of the legacy football world. This club is all rootsy culture, history, legend, Diego-scale iconography, the Argentina of Argentina. And in the black corner, well, we have something else entirely. Authenticity: meet the Fifa Club World Cup, the most plasticised, commodified football competition ever devised. There was something a little uncomfortable about this spectacle. Here is Fifa saying lend us your edge, your colour, your clout, your stamp. Make us feel real. In the build up to this game Fifa\u2019s reliably unctuous website had described Boca as \u201ca nomadic passion\u201d. And this is the business plan in one handy phrase. Instant reality, bolt-on culture. On the other hand, why not if it pays well? The thing about Boca and the other non-European teams is that they genuinely want to be here. And for obvious reasons too, finally offered a piece of the global broadcast pot that doesn\u2019t involve acting as a talent plantation. This what Gianni Infantino is getting at with his boilerplate chat about diversity and inclusion. Look. South America is getting a cut. Don\u2019t you want to share? This is also a little misleading. Boca will now have a cash boost, via Fifa/Dazn/Saudi, which means they can buy again, come back again, fed by this new stream of income. In effect Fifa is creating client clubs, a mini-elite to staff the show. For now Boca brought some authentic World Cup energy to this pop-up stage, as they were always going to do. This is a vast sporting enterprise with its own global reach. And after a slightly dozy start they began to play with some real fury. Boca\u2019s tactics were not complex. They kept a low block, challenged fiercely, broke at speed. The energetically squat Alan Velasco had their first shot at goal, veering into space and skimming the ball just over the bar. With 11 minutes gone we had the first mass vibration of the Boca fans leaping in unison and making even this vast mound of concrete and steel throb delicately. And 10 minutes later Boca scored, the goal made by Lautaro Blanco, who shimmied his way inside and crossed low for Miguel Merentiel to nudge the ball on into the far corner. The bodies seethed and writhed in the stands. And shortly afterwards it was 2-0, Rodrigo Battaglia heading in after a flick back across goal from a corner. This time the bench was cleared, the bibbed players streaming on, the stands in uproar, a noise that seemed to have many layers, hitting you in the chest, ears, teeth. Watching Boca defend in that period was like watching a group of hugely energetic construction workers demolishing a bungalow in formation, all hungry, rotational collisions. It was fun to see this kind of defending, not pressing or denying space or shutting down angles in the European style, but going straight for the man, rushing from the block to attack the ball. Benfica looked a bit unprepared for this. But they were awarded a soft penalty before half-time, beautifully rolled into the corner against a fury of whistles and boos by \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, who has heard this stuff before. The second half brought more of the same, both sets of players running themselves into a state of desiccated exhaustion. With 72 minutes gone Andrea Belotti was sent off for a high boot into the head of Ayrton Costa. Jorge Figal got an instant straight red at the death for a targeted assault on the shins of the nearest man to the ball. And that was pretty much that. No doubt some will see an endorsement of Fifa\u2019s vampire show in the sheer vivid life of this game. But it felt like an act of defiance too, evidence of a culture and an energy that exists undiminished outside of all this.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/17/club-world-cup-boca-juniors-benfica-match-report", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "As Boca Juniors tore into a 2-0 first half lead against Benfica, as the stadium interior was transformed into a sustained static field by the Boca fans, as the coaching staff on both benches leapt up in random rotation, like the world\u2019s angriest improv night, this already felt like the real thing, blood, vim, borrowed life."}, {"title": "Trump news at a glance: Axing Russia from G8 was a mistake, says Trump before leaving summit early ", "description": "US president lobbying G7 leaders for Russia to be readmitted to global grouping \u2013 key US politics stories from Monday 16 June", "content": "Donald Trump has told G7 leaders gathered for its summit in Canada that removing Russia from the former G8 was a mistake, and is lobbying for the country to be readmitted.

A Colorado jury decided the case and amount after Eric Coomer, who formerly worked in security and voting technology strategy for the voting machine company Dominion, filed a lawsuit against Lindell and a host of others who spread false conspiracy theories that upended his life. Coomer\u2019s attorneys had originally requested $62.7m. Lindell testified in the case, saying he didn\u2019t make any knowingly false comments about Coomer. He said Coomer\u2019s claims about him led to him being unable to go on Newsmax shows \u2013 the rightwing outlet was also sued by Coomer and settled.

The lawsuit came after rumors spread about Coomer online following the 2020 election, which Donald Trump lost. A rightwing podcaster in Colorado, Joe Oltmann, claimed a man who identified himself as \u201cEric the Dominion guy\u201d had been on an \u201cantifa\u201d call before the election where he said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the election, Trump is not gonna win. I made fucking sure of that.\u201d Oltmann has not provided any evidence of the call. Oltmann, who also faces a lawsuit from Coomer, testified in the case and continued to say Coomer was on the supposed call, which he insisted did actually happen. Coomer filed the lawsuit against Lindell in April 2022. Lindell accused Coomer of treason. Coomer\u2019s attorneys have argued Lindell\u2019s statements about Coomer were in part motivated by Newsmax not allowing Lindell to go on its programs after the company settled the lawsuit Coomer brought against it for spreading false claims, according to the Denver Post. Lindell\u2019s attorneys said Coomer\u2019s lawsuit against Lindell \u201ctriggered\u201d the pillow salesman into defaming Coomer, the paper reported. Throughout the trial, Lindell\u2019s online TV platform has covered the case and sought to sell its products as a way to help Lindell. Lindell is in financial trouble, he has said repeatedly. He is also being sued by Dominion and Smartmatic, another voting machine company. Lindell has struggled to pay for his legal defense \u2013 a law firm that was representing him sought to be removed from his cases because he owed them millions of dollars and couldn\u2019t pay, the Star Tribune reported. He was also served with a new lawsuit outside the Denver courthouse, this one from FedEx over $9m in unpaid fees, according to a local TV reporter there. On a website for Lindell\u2019s legal defense fund, he writes that he would never settle the lawsuits against him, which he refers to as \u201clawfare\u201d. He said during the trial that he was $10m in debt. \u201cThe electronic voting machine companies and Eric Coomer are trying to silence me and scare anyone who dares to ask questions. But I won\u2019t back down. I\u2019ve put everything on the line \u2013 my business, my reputation, my time \u2013 because I believe God put me on this mission,\u201d the website says. A crowdfunding page for Lindell\u2019s legal defense has raised more than $400,000. Coomer testified that he had gone into hiding and experienced death threats as a result of the persistent lies about him. An expert hired by his side said it would cost about $2.8m for him to repair his reputation, according to Colorado Public Radio. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s to try to regain some semblance of my life. I didn\u2019t just lose my livelihood, I lost my life as a direct result of statements by Mr Lindell accusing me of being a traitor,\u201d Coomer said.

The mayor\u2019s office said there was \u201coverwhelming public and business support\u201d for the proposals to regenerate the street, whose lustre is slowly returning as department stores muscle back among the sweet and souvenir shops of dubious repute. More than 6,600 businesses, individuals and groups responded to the formal consultation on plans announced last year that included full pedestrianisation of a 0.7-mile strip west from Great Portland Street; improving the area; and allowing street cafes and outdoor events. Khan said: \u201cOxford Street has suffered over many years, so urgent action is needed to give our nation\u2019s high street a new lease of life. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the vast majority of Londoners and major businesses back our exciting plans, so I\u2019m pleased to confirm that we will now be moving ahead as quickly as possible.\u201d The Labour government has said it will approve a mayoral development corporation (MDC) to push through plans, after previous attempts to pedestrianise the street were knocked back by Westminster city council. An MDC could now be established in early 2026, including representation from the council, which even now under Labour control has opposed the scheme. Cllr Adam Hug, the leader of the council, said: \u201cWhile the mayor\u2019s formal decision today was not the council\u2019s preferred outcome, it is far from unexpected, and it is now important for Oxford Street\u2019s future to move forward together.\u201d He added that since 2022 the street had \u201croared back to life after the pandemic\u201d and said the council would work with Khan to see it \u201creimagined\u201d in a way that worked for visitors, shoppers and residents. Oxford Street is already largely restricted to general traffic but is a key route for London buses and taxis. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the LTDA, which represents black-cab drivers, thought the plans would worsen congestion in the capital. \u201cPutting this traffic down surrounding streets will cause chaos \u2013 we\u2019re already Europe\u2019s most congested city, maybe we\u2019ll now get the world title,\u201d he said. Detailed traffic proposals to reroute buses and ban all traffic will be released and consulted on later this year. Khan added: \u201cWe want to rejuvenate Oxford Street; establish it as a global leader for shopping, leisure and outdoor events with a world-class, accessible, pedestrianised avenue. This will help to attract more international visitors, and act as a magnet for new investment and job creation, driving growth and economic prosperity for decades to come.\u201d Angela Rayner, he deputy prime minister, said: \u201cWe want to see Oxford Street become the thriving place to be for tourists and Londoners alike, and that\u2019s why we welcome the mayor of London\u2019s bold proposals to achieve that.\u201d The big retailers on the street, including Ikea, which recently opened its a store there, also backed the mayor.

The pressure is so intense that 27% of control room staff in ambulance services across Britain have left their jobs over the last three years, NHS figures show. Many feel overwhelmed by the demands of their roles, unsupported by their employers and powerless to help patients who are facing life-or-death emergencies, according to a report by Unison, with some resigning within a year of starting the role. Call handlers get so stressed that they took an average of 33 sick days a year each between 2021/22 and 2024/25, data obtained by the union also showed. That is far higher than the average four days taken off sick by workers in the UK overall. A report by Unison found that call handlers\u2019 jobs have become increasingly challenging in recent years as the demand for care, which rose during Covid, has remained consistently high since, while ambulance handover delays outside hospitals have worsened. In March control room staff in England, Scotland and Wales answered more than 700,000 calls \u2013 more than 22,000 a day. \u201cThese findings paint a bleak picture of the conditions faced by 999 control room staff. TV programmes about ambulance services don\u2019t show things as they really are,\u201d said Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary. Unison\u2019s report said: \u201cRelentless exposure to traumatic and increasingly complex incidents, verbal abuse, long shifts and low pay are contributing to stress, burnout and fatigue. One call handler told Unison: \u201cSome shifts are overwhelmingly traumatic, with 90% of the calls of a distressing nature. One shift, I handled three road traffic accidents and two cardiac arrests.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a persistent pressure to remain on the phone, no matter how emotionally drained we are.\u201d Another had dealt with four different calls about suicide in the same shift. A third said: \u201cIt\u2019s relentless. You log in, take emotionally intense calls for 12 hours straight and then go home. \u201cCertain calls stay with you. I once spoke to a distressed mother whose daughter had suffered life-changing burns. The panic in her voice is something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Several call handlers identified lack of support for dealing with the emotional and psychological impact of their jobs as a key reason why so many people leave. Unison obtained data from 11 of the UK\u2019s 13 NHS regional ambulance services. They also found that some call handlers end up being off sick for several months because of stress and trauma, 80% of the South East Coast ambulance service\u2019s (Secamb) call handlers left during 2023/24, and that Secamb also had the highest average number of days off sick taken by its call handlers \u2013 54 days each in 2023/24. NHS England said call handlers played a vital role in the urgent and emergency care system and admitted that they needed to do more to support them.

Radiographers, who take X-rays and scans, fear the trend could compromise the privacy of other patients being treated nearby and lead to staff having their work discussed online. The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has gone public with its unease after a spate of incidents in which patients, or someone with them in the hospital, began filming their care. On one occasion a radiology department assistant from the south coast was inserting a cannula into a patient who had cancer when their 19-year-old daughter began filming. \u201cShe wanted to record the cannulation because she thought it would be entertaining on social media. But she didn\u2019t ask permission,\u201d the staff member said. \u201cI spent the weekend afterwards worrying: did I do my job properly? I know I did, but no one\u2019s perfect all the time and this was recorded.

In a watershed moment for the US media, 54% of Americans said they received news from social media, according to the research carried out after President Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Half said they sourced news from the once all-powerful TV networks. The accelerating global shift towards social media and video platforms is laid bare in a major study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which surveyed almost 100,000 news consumers worldwide. It reveals a further diminishing of the influence of traditional news organisations, with more people heading to podcasters, YouTubers and TikTokers. The authors warned it is allowing populist politicians such as Trump and Argentina\u2019s Javier Milei to bypass the scrutiny of the transitional media in favour of new, online networks. The role of news influencers, who use their personal brand to win an online following, is growing, led by the extraordinary impact of the podcaster Joe Rogan during last year\u2019s US presidential election. One-fifth (22%) of those contacted in the US said they came across news or commentary from Rogan in the week after the presidential inauguration, including a disproportionate number of young men, a group traditional media struggles to reach. News influencers on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok are also finding large audiences in India, Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand, which have younger populations that are heavy social media users. Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s X has seen a major shift to the right among its users, according to the analysis. Musk\u2019s takeover of the site has been followed by a 50% increase among right-leaning users, from 10% of the group in 2021 to 15% this year. There has been a corresponding fall in left-leaning users, from 17% to 14% over the same period, as liberals have abandoned the platform. The findings confirm the huge changes taking place in news consumption worldwide. \u201cThe rise of social video and personality-driven news represents another significant challenge for traditional publishers that are struggling to adapt their content and tone to these very different environments,\u201d said Nic Newman, a founding member of the BBC News website and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cOnline video may be a good way to engage younger audiences, but there is very little commercial upside for publishers, with most news consumption taking place via platforms rather than owned and operated news websites. Publishers also face a loss of influence, with populist politicians increasingly looking to bypass scrutiny by working with sympathetic influencers instead.\u201d A decade ago, just two online networks were delivering news content to more than 10% of the report\u2019s global sample. That has now grown to six. Facebook reaches more than a third (36%), while YouTube is not far behind (30%). Instagram and WhatsApp are used by around a fifth for news content, while 16% turn to TikTok and 12% still receive news from X. There are concerns that truth will suffer. Overall, 58% of the populations studied remain worried about their ability to tell what is true from what is false online. Concern is highest in Africa (73%) and the US (73%). The phenomenon of news avoidance continues to rise as users restrict the amount they consume, complaining about feeling overwhelmed by a gloomy news agenda. Four in 10 people in the study\u2019s global sample said they sometimes or often avoid the news \u2013 up from 29% in 2017 \u2013 the joint highest figure ever recorded. The UK has one of the highest proportions of news avoiders, where 46% say they sometimes or often avoid the news. In another major change on the horizon, young people are already turning to artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini for news. It poses a serious risk to news companies as users may receive all the information they need through a chatbot without ever visiting the original source of the story. The numbers using chatbots for news are still relatively small overall, but are higher with under-35s at 12% of the group. Across all the countries involved in the study, people expect AI will make the news cheaper and more up-to-date but less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/17/social-media-overtakes-tv-as-main-source-of-news-in-us-analysis-finds", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Social media has overtaken television as a source of news in the US for the first time, according to a comprehensive analysis of media consumption confirming the rapid rise of \u201cnews influencers\u201d.

On Saturday, as mass protests swept the nation, including tens of thousands demonstrating in LA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents descended on a swap meet in Santa Fe Springs in southeast LA county. Video showed dozens of heavily armed, masked officers carrying out the raid before a scheduled concert at the long-running event that features vendors, food and entertainment every weekend Witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that agents appeared to be going after people who \u201clooked Hispanic in any way\u201d, sparking widespread fear. A US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said on Monday that it arrested two people at the swap meet who are now facing deportation. The crowd at the swap meet largely cleared out before a scheduled 5.30pm concert, which was ultimately canceled, leaving the site unusually empty for a spring Saturday. Another witness told ABC7 agents were asking attendees where they were from: \u201cI told them I was from the United States, and then they proceeded to walk away, and they took a picture of me \u2026 I took it as a personal threat.\u201d The swap meet arrests came at the end of more than a week of sustained raids and Ice activity in the region that have targeted day laborers outside Home Depot, car washers, warehouse workers, people outside churches and other residents in public spaces. The raids have continued as Donald Trump has sent the national guard and marines to LA to respond to protests, despite the objections of California leaders, who have sued to stop a deployment they deem unconstitutional. Also over the weekend, video emerged of immigration actions in Montebello, a suburb east of the city of LA. Last Thursday, armed border patrol agents, who drove in an unmarked car, ended up detaining Jason Brian Gavidia and pressing him against a fence by an auto body shop he runs, the New York Times reported. An agent interrogated Gavidia, a US citizen, asking, \u201cWhat hospital were you born at?\u201d Gavidia, 29, was born down the street, and video shows agents twisting his arm, as he said, \u201cI\u2019m American! \u2026 I\u2019ll show you my ID.

Salvador Melendez, the mayor of Montebello, a city that is 79% Latino, told the Guardian on Monday that the videos and reports of Ice in his community had caused widespread anxiety. \u201cThis is racial profiling. They\u2019re stopping folks because of the way they look,\u201d said Melendez. \u201cIce agents are terrorizing our community. They are taking actions and asking questions later. There is absolutely no due process.\u201d Ice agents were spotted in a small area of Montebello, the mayor said. \u201cBut psychologically, they are already in our whole city. People are not going to work, not going out, not going to school. People don\u2019t want to ride the bus. It\u2019s extremely unfair \u2026 seeing Ice agents come in with these big guns, it almost feels like a war zone. They\u2019re militarized to apprehend folks and they rough up our people.\u201d After millions protested Trump in national \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations, the president pledged Sunday to escalate Ice raids in Democratic-run cities, including LA, Chicago and New York. \u201cFolks have to stay vigilant, we have to look out for one another. If you see something, alert your neighbors,\u201d said Melendez. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to see people coming together, helping their neighbors and rallying against this \u2026 This is not normal and we have to be outspoken.\u201d Immigrant rights\u2019 lawyers have said that people detained in the raids have disappeared or had little contact with their attorneys or families. Amid the crackdown, residents across the region have increasingly gone into hiding, turning typically lively immigrant hubs desolate. DHS and border patrol did not respond to inquiries about the detentions in Montebello, but Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary, said in a press release Monday: \u201cDHS targets have nothing to do with an individuals\u2019 skin color. What makes someone a target is if they are in the United States illegally.\u201d A spokesperson added in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cDHS and its components continue to enforce the law every day in greater Los Angeles and throughout the country \u2026 DHS agencies will not be deterred from the completion of our mission.\u201d The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, has continued to keep a curfew in place for the downtown neighborhood that has been at the center of protests, but some activities in the center of the city have resumed, including theatrical performances. And while the national guard remains deployed, as the courts consider California\u2019s objections, many areas in the LA region were functioning relatively normally, with little sign of the protests and the aggressive federal response. But signs of the immigration crackdown are still being felt across the city. In LA\u2019s Koreatown, a dense immigrant neighborhood, street vendors have been staying home out of fear of raids, causing significant financial hardships, said Andreina Kniss, an organizer with Ktown for All, a mutual aid group. Volunteers identified more than 60 families of vendors out of work and fundraised more than $50,000 for them, she said. The group had distributed funds to 36 families covering a month of expenses, as of Monday morning, allowing vulnerable workers to stay home. \u201cWe felt like we couldn\u2019t stand around and watch them have to make the choice between being kidnapped and paying their bills,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city is being held hostage economically, and it\u2019s not going to end until these Ice raids end.\u201d She hoped to see mutual aid efforts expand: \u201cThe $2,000 you raise for a family might prevent a family separation.

The lawsuit concerned the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to $400m worth of federal funding to Columbia on the grounds it tolerated antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Columbia largely accepted the government\u2019s terms for restoring funding \u2013 in an agreement widely panned as a capitulation of its own academic freedom \u2013 several days before the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) sued the Trump administration over the cuts. The judge in the case, Mary Kay Vyskocil of the southern district of New York, ruled that the faculty unions had no \u201cstanding\u201d to bring the suit and had not clearly indicated how the administration had broken the law. \u201cIt is not the role of a district court judge to direct the policies of the Executive Branch first and ask questions later,\u201d the judge, a Trump appointee, wrote in her 30-page ruling. \u201cPlaintiffs have not established their standing to litigate this case, let alone any violation of any law.\u201d She seemed to accept the government\u2019s prerogative to withhold funding and its argument that Columbia had enabled antisemitism to fester on campus.

That funding has not yet been restored though the education secretary Linda McMahon recently said that Columbia had \u201cmade great progress\u201d and that the administration was considering a consent decree with the university. The administration has also cut billions in funding to several other universities, warning dozens more that it is investigating them over alleged antisemitism on campuses. So far, Harvard, which has lost more than $3bn in federal funding, is the only university to sue the administration in two separate lawsuits, one over funding cuts and another against the administration\u2019s ban on Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll international students. On Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts extended a temporary block on the administration\u2019s order concerning Harvard\u2019s foreign students. The AAUP has filed three other lawsuits against the Trump administration \u2013 over its ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students and funding cuts at Harvard.

The two leaders presented the deal, which covers aerospace and the auto sector, at the G7 venue in Kananaskis, Alberta. Asked about steel by reporters, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you have that information in a little while.\u201d Under details released by the Department for Business and Trade, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US, while the auto industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%. The steel industry still faces 25% tariffs for now, although this is less than the US\u2019s global rate of 50% on steel and aluminium. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to \u201cmake progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\u201d. However, the US executive order implementing the deal highlighted a possible hiccup over steel tariffs. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel. In a paragraph setting out a future move to \u201cmost-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles\u201d, the order says the UK has \u201ccommitted to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities\u201d. This would seem to refer to US worries about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel even though the UK government took control of the company in April to stop Jingye closing its Scunthorpe plant. Trump\u2019s administration wants assurances that Jingye does not use British Steel as a way to circumvent US tariffs. A full version of the deal first outlined in May had been seen as imminent, but Downing Street will be particularly happy to have it finalised at the summit, with full endorsement from a cheerful Trump \u2013 even if he did wrongly say the deal was with the EU. \u201cI just signed it, and it\u2019s done. And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union, and it\u2019s a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we have many, many other ones coming. But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good, but the relationship that we have is fantastic.\u201d As has been his habit in recent meetings with Starmer, the mercurial president was warm in his praise for a fellow leader who is not a political soulmate. \u201cWe\u2019re very longtime partners and allies and friends, and we\u2019ve become friends in a short period of time. He\u2019s slightly more liberal than I am,\u201d Trump joked at one point. Asked if the UK was now protected from future tariffs, Trump said: \u201cThe UK is very well protected. You know why?

Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator of Virginia, on Monday introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit US armed forces from taking direct action against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress or a declaration of war. The measure, like other attempts to claw back power from the executive branch, faces a steep climb in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans have been mostly unwilling to challenge Donald Trump\u2019s authority. \u201cI am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,\u201d Kaine said in a statement. \u201cThe American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation\u2019s men and women in uniform into harm\u2019s way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.\u201d Later on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, introduced a separate piece of legislation that would bar the use of federal funds for any use of military force \u201cin or against Iran\u201d without congressional authorization. Several progressive Democrats, including senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland joined as sponsors. \u201cAnother war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cI will do everything that I can as a Senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the US from being drawn into another war.\u201d Sanders has accused Israel of timing its attack on Iran to \u201csabotage\u201d the latest round of talks between the US and Iran over the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear program that had been scheduled for Sunday but were cancelled. Trump on Monday said Iranian officials would \u201clike to talk\u201d about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, while Israel indicated its attacks on Iran were not yet finished. Trump \u2013 along with Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have issued stark warnings to Iran not to strike US targets as it launches retaliatory attacks. \u201cIf we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. War powers resolutions are considered \u201cprivileged\u201d under Senate rules, guaranteeing a floor debate and vote. Even if Kaine\u2019s measure ultimately fails, it will compel lawmakers to confront pressing questions about the US role in the rapidly escalating Middle East conflict \u2013 and, more broadly, about presidential war powers and Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over decisions of war and peace. Kaine\u2019s resolution would not prevent the US from defending itself against imminent threats but would require congressional approval for offensive action. Sanders\u2019 bill contains an exception for self-defense. On matters of foreign policy, Trump\u2019s coalition includes Iran hawks like Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as \u201cAmerica First\u201d subscribers who share the president\u2019s longstanding opposition to US involvement in foreign conflicts. Graham on Sunday said he preferred a diplomatic solution, but barring that, he urged the president to \u201cgo all in\u201d. \u201cMake sure that, when this operation is over, there\u2019s nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program,\u201d he said in an interview on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cIf that means providing bombs, provide bombs.\u201d Kaine\u2019s move is part of a long-running effort to rein in presidential war powers, which has in the past brought together unlikely partnerships between Democrats and a growing faction of far-right anti-interventionists. During Trump\u2019s first term, Kaine led a similar effort to limit Trump\u2019s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval, following the president\u2019s decision to order the killing of Iranian Gen Qasem Soleimani, which brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. Though both chambers of Congress approved the resolution, Trump vetoed it. That veto followed an earlier one in 2019, when Trump blocked a separate bipartisan War Powers resolution aimed at ending US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s intervention in Yemen\u2019s civil war \u2013 an effort that drew support from Democrats and a small group of anti-interventionist Republicans.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-war-powers-iran-israel-conflict", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator of Virginia, on Monday introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit US armed forces from taking direct action against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress or a declaration of war."}, {"title": "Spanish-language journalist to be turned over to Ice after protest arrest", "description": "El Salvador-born Mario Guevara, arrested by Georgia police on Saturday, transferred to Ice officers after bond release", "content": "Mario Guevara, a prominent Spanish-language journalist in metro Atlanta who frequently covers immigration and customs enforcement raids, will be turned over to Ice detention after being arrested by local police while covering the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests.

He recorded his own arrest on Saturday during a raucous street protest in the Embry Hills area of north DeKalb county, an Atlanta suburban neighborhood with a large Latino population. The protest ended with riot police throwing teargas and marching protesters down the street after declaring an unlawful assembly. About 35 minutes into the video Guevara was live-streaming on Facebook to more than 1 million people, he can be first seen on the sidewalk, then backing away from a police officer approaching him.

The earlier \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest had been organized and promoted by Indivisible and 50501. Conversely, organizers from the Party of Socialism and Liberation led the Embry Hills protest. According to a release from the DeKalb police department, police declared an unlawful assembly after they believed marchers would attempt to approach the highway on the on-ramp. Police arrested eight people including Guevara at the protest on Saturday. Ted Terry, a DeKalb county commissioner, asked the county\u2019s staff to investigate the circumstances around the use of teargas at the event. \u201cThe decision to deploy teargas \u2013 particularly in a neighborhood context with nearby homes and businesses \u2013 raises serious questions about the proportionality and justification of the county\u2019s response to peaceful civil action,\u201d he wrote. A spokesperson for Ice in Atlanta could not immediately confirm the conditions of the immigration hold or whether Guevara faces deportation. As a journalist with Diario CoLatino in El Salvador, he fled the country in 2004 one step ahead of threats from leftwing paramilitary groups. It took him seven years to get his first asylum hearing before a judge, the journalist told Spanish-language wire service Agencia EFE in the Los Angeles-based publication La Opini\u00f3n in 2012.

The post on Monday on X was from the account of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Arabic spokesperson, Col Avichay Adraee, and is a further sign of the evolving nature of the Israeli campaign against Iran, which began with attacks on air defences, nuclear sites and the military chain of command, but appears to have drifted towards a war of attrition focused on Iran\u2019s oil and gas industry and on the capital. In another sign of the changing targets of the Israeli offensive, Iran\u2019s state TV announced on Monday evening during a live transmission that it was under attack. The sound of an explosion could be heard, and the news presenter hurried off camera as dust and debris appeared in the studio. Cries of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d or \u201cGod is greatest\u201d could be heard off-screen and the broadcast abruptly switched to pre-recorded programming. Live programming resumed some time later. Adraee\u2019s online post included a map depicting a significant area of the third district in northern Tehran shaded in red in the same manner he has presented evacuation orders for Palestinians. \u201cDear citizens, for your safety, please leave the described area in the 3rd district of Tehran immediately,\u201d the message said in Farsi. \u201cIn the coming hours, the Israeli army will attack the military infrastructure of the Iranian regime in this area, as it has done in recent days in Tehran. Your presence in this area endangers your life.\u201d Later on Monday, the US president, Donald Trump, urged everyone to immediately evacuate Tehran, and reiterated that Iran should have signed a nuclear deal with the US. \u201cIRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\u201d he said in a post on Truth Social. Speaking to personnel at Tel Nof air force base, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed the evacuation orders. \u201cThe Israeli air force controls the skies over Tehran. This changes the entire campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we control the skies over Tehran, we strike regime targets, as opposed to the criminal Iranian regime which targets our civilians and comes to kill women and children. We tell the people of Tehran to evacuate, and we act.\u201d Netanyahu later said killing Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would \u201cend the conflict\u201d in what would be another ominous escalation. After the surprise Israeli attack on Friday morning, Iran has carried out retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli cities, focusing on the most populated areas between Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa. Both sides have targeted each other\u2019s oil and gas facilities, increasing the threat of environmental disaster, and explosions were reported on Monday near oil refineries in southern Tehran. Earlier on Monday, Iran threatened to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) as Israeli bombing raids entered a fourth day, underlining the conflict\u2019s potential to trigger a broader war and Tehran\u2019s race to construct a nuclear weapon. The human cost of the war continued to escalate with both sides broadening their range of targets, as G7 leaders convened in the Canadian Rockies with no clear plan to end the conflict. There were reports on Monday that Trump was refusing to sign a joint statement calling for the conflict to be scaled down. \u201cThey should talk, and they should talk immediately,\u201d Trump said of Tehran during the summit. \u201cI\u2019d say Iran is not winning this war.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Iran was sending a message to Israel and the US through Arab intermediaries that it was seeking a cessation of hostilities and a resumption of talks on its nuclear programme. The same report, however, said its stance was that it would only go back to the table if Israel halted its offensive. There was no sign on Monday of Israel contemplating a pause. Iran\u2019s health ministry said 224 people in Iran had been killed by Israeli attacks, 90% of them civilian, and more than 1,400 had been injured. Israel\u2019s defence minister, meanwhile, threatened further bombing strikes on Tehran, where an exodus of residents has been reported, clogging roads out of the capital. The Iranian Red Crescent said that three of its rescuers were killed in an Israeli airstrike in northwest Tehran, adding: \u201cThis incident is not only a crime against international humanitarian law but also a blatant attack on humanity and morality.\u201d In Israel, at least 23 civilians have been killed in Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile strikes since Israel\u2019s initial surprise attack on Friday morning, and nearly 600 have been injured, according to official sources. The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Monday that Iran\u2019s parliament, the Majlis, was preparing a bill that would withdraw the country from the 1968 NPT agreement, which obliges it to forego nuclear weapons and to undergo international inspections to verify compliance. Baghaei added that Tehran remained opposed to the development of weapons of mass destruction. The country\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, also insisted that Iran did not intend to develop nuclear weapons but would pursue its right to nuclear energy and research. He pointed out that Ali Khamenei, had issued a religious edict against weapons of mass destruction. Israel is the only Middle East state with nuclear weapons and did not sign the NPT, but has never formally acknowledged its arsenal. It is seeking to maintain its monopoly with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was close to building a bomb. Previous assessments by US intelligence and the UN nuclear watchdog found no evidence that Iran had begun work on assembling a nuclear weapon. Israeli critics of the offensive say it cannot destroy Iran\u2019s reserve of nuclear knowhow \u2013 though Israel has targeted Iranian nuclear scientists, claiming to have killed 14 \u2013 and could push the leadership into ordering the assembly of nuclear warheads. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC it was very likely all the roughly 15,000 centrifuges at Iran\u2019s biggest uranium enrichment plant at Natanz had been badly damaged or destroyed because of a power cut caused by an Israeli strike. But he said there had been very limited or no damage at the separate Fordow plant. There were reports on Monday of Israeli strikes on the Tehran headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force, an expeditionary arm deployed in foreign wars. Despite Israeli claims to have air superiority over much of Iran, Iranian forces have still been able to launch ballistic missiles from their territory and some continue to evade Israel\u2019s multi-layered air defences. Israel Defense Forces officials estimate that it is has been able to intercept 80-90% of Iran\u2019s missiles, with 5-10% hitting actual residential areas. Eight more Israelis were killed overnight by Iranian missile strikes, including four in Petah Tikva where a missile hit an apartment block. Three people died from blasts in Haifa and an elderly man was killed when his home collapsed from the shockwave from an explosion in Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have begun \u201cmore powerful and deadly\u201d strikes and to have found a way of causing confusion in Israeli air defence systems. There was no immediate way of independently verifying the claim. US forces have so far helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles, but have not taken part, at least overtly, in offensive bombing operations. On Monday, however, Reuters quoted two unnamed US officials as saying the movement of more than 30 military refuelling aircraft to Europe was intended to give Trump more options in the Middle East. Such tankers allow warplanes to refuel in mid-air and enable more sorties a day in wartime. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Monday he had ordered the deployment of additional defensive capabilities to the Middle East, but did not disclose what military capabilities he sent to the region. As Tehran residents evacuated the capital in increasing numbers, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened to make Tehranis \u201cpay the price\u201d for Ali Khamenei\u2019s decision to keep firing missiles at Israel in retaliation for the Israeli attack.

The deal was announced on the day the transfer window reopened after an earlier Club World Cup\u2011related opportunity to make signings. The window will close on Monday 1 September. Leeds fear that Jaka Bijol\u2019s mooted move to Elland Road could be hijacked. The 26-year-old Udinese and Slovenia centre-half is very close to signing for Daniel Farke\u2019s promoted team but late interest from other clubs, notably Newcastle and Milan, may place that \u00a317m deal in peril. Bijol, though predominantly right-sided, is two-footed and has the sort of high-calibre passing range that betrays his origins as a defensive midfielder. Throw in his aerial ability and controlled aggression and it is easy to understand why the former CSKA Moscow player, who faced England at Euro 2024, is so admired by Farke. Eddie Howe, Newcastle\u2019s manager, is also seeking a right\u2011sided, ball-playing central defender to compete for that berth with Fabian Sch\u00e4r. Howe\u2019s principal target is Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Gu\u00e9hi but the England centre-half could prove out of reach. Newcastle hope to sign the Brighton forward Jo\u00e3o Pedro and the Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford but both potential transfers could prove complicated and will not come cheap. Farke has signed Lukas Nmecha, the 26-year-old former Germany forward, on a free transfer from Wolfsburg, but Howe is waiting to welcome a new face. Crystal Palace are poised to announce the signing of Walter Ben\u00edtez on a free transfer after the Argentina goalkeeper completed his medical. The 32-year-old was out of contract at PSV after helping them to win the Eredivisie title in his third season and will compete with Dean Henderson to be No 1 at Selhurst Park. Matt Turner was backup to the England international last season after signing on loan from Nottingham Forest and is expected to join Lyon in a permanent deal. Ben\u00edtez, who played more than 150 games for Nice before joining PSV, won his first senior cap last year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/16/bournemouth-sign-adrien-truffert-liverpool-milos-kerkez", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "Bournemouth have signed the France left-back Adrien Truffert from Rennes on a five-year contract.

Please join me in condemning this senseless violence, and praying for the victims and their families,\u201d he wrote on Twitter/X. That was from his official account. On his personal X account, he posted a series of memes concerning the attacks that left former Minnesota state house speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark dead, and state senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette seriously injured. \u201cThis is what happens When Marxists don\u2019t get their way,\u201d Lee posted, along with a photo of the alleged gunman, who was arrested on Sunday. He followed that up by posting the photo and writing \u201cNightmare on Waltz Street\u201d, an apparent misspelling of Tim Walz, the state\u2019s Democratic governor who became nationally known last year as Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate. Such was the split screen that played out among Republicans after the Saturday morning shootings, which were the latest in a wave of political violence across the United States that has most recently seen two assassination attempts targeting Donald Trump as he campaigned for president, a flamethrower attack on a rally for Israeli hostages in Colorado and a slew of threats targeting judges who have ruled against the US president. While many in the GOP condemned the attacks in Minnesota, others have used it as an opportunity to poke fun at their Democratic opponents, or suggest that they somehow instigated the violence. Experts warn it may be the latter statements that reach the bigger audience. \u201cI think there\u2019s no question that these messages are representative of the modern GOP more so than any stock thoughts and prayers tweet that a staffer puts up,\u201d said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Democrats have been unequivocal in condemning the shootings, as have Congress\u2019s top Republicans. \u201cSuch horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it,\u201d said House speaker, Mike Johnson. Senate majority leader, John Thune, said he was \u201chorrified at the events unfolding in Minnesota\u201d and that \u201cpolitical violence has no place in our nation\u201d. Minnesota\u2019s Republican party condemned the shooting, as did the state\u2019s entire congressional delegation. But when it comes to Trump and his most vociferous allies on social media, the message is more mixed. Trump initially condemned the attacks, saying on Saturday: \u201cSuch horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\u201d But the following day, he struck a different tone, telling ABC News that the shooting was \u201ca terrible thing\u201d but calling Walz \u201ca terrible governor\u201d and \u201ca grossly incompetent person\u201d. \u201cI may call him, I may call other people too,\u201d he added. On Monday afternoon, Walz\u2019s office said Trump had not called. Meanwhile, on X, prominent rightwing figures were quick to promote conspiracy theories about what happened. Elon Musk, the erstwhile Trump sidekick who runs Tesla, shared a tweet from a pro-Trump account that read, in part: \u201cThe left has become a full blown domestic terrorist organization.\u201d \u201cThe far left is murderously violent\u201d Musk wrote in his reply, which Lee shared, adding: \u201cFact check: TRUE\u201d. Laura Loomer, the rightwing extremist who is said to have played a role in encouraging Trump to fire national security officials, alleged the suspect had ties to the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests that took place nationwide on Saturday, and that Walz knew him. The spread of outlandish falsehoods and conspiracy theories on social media has been a hallmark of the atmosphere Trump has brought to US politics over the past decade, and Lewis believes the country is now at a point where such fabrications have more prominence than politicians\u2019 carefully written statements. \u201cThe real problem now is that nothing matters, and I think that has been realized by the mainstream right in this country. There are no consequences for peddling disinformation or conspiracies,\u201d he said. Robert Pape, director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that the United States had entered an era of \u201cviolent populism\u201d, and if Democrats and Republicans want to stop it, they need to issue joint statements speaking out against atrocities like what happened in Minnesota. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start having some agreement here on negotiating these rules of the road, so to speak, because if each side continues to simply only accept unconditional surrender by the other, well, then just like in Ukraine, you\u2019re not going to end this thing very, very soon, and things will just escalate,\u201d Pape said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/republicans-trump-minnesota-lawmakers-killings", "source": "The Guardian", "summary": "On his personal X account, he posted a series of memes concerning the attacks that left former Minnesota state house speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark dead, and state senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette seriously injured.
